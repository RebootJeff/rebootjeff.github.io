<p class="my-caption">Presenting my project, Co-Compare, to the folks of Hack Reactor</p>

<h1 id="life-update">Life Update</h1>

<p>I got a job! I will start using my JS skills for dolla bills on Monday. I will blog all about my rather tiring job search soon. For now, I will resume blogging about Hack Reactor from <a href="http://rebootjeff.github.io/blog/2013/10/28/hackr-diary-week-5/">where I left off</a>. During the 2nd half of the program, I didn’t do any blogging, but I took plenty of notes for the sake of blogging at a later time, so prepare to be amazed …or mildly amused. Remember, the following rollercoaster ride took place during late-October through mid-November.</p>

<h1 id="recap-of-events">Recap of Events</h1>

<h2 id="interim-week-different-format">Interim Week (different format)</h2>

<p>The 2nd half of Hack Reactor starts with an “interim week” (aka “solo week”) where expectations are a bit cloudy. <strong>The Hack Reactor website didn’t do a good job of explaining that the injection of an interim week means that Hack Reactor is really a 13-week program.</strong> During this special week, Hack Reactor HQ is not guaranteed to be open to students. Also, students are not guaranteed any access to staff. The staff is either taking a break or working on reconfiguring the offices or other changes.</p>

<p>In other words, the students are on their own for starting the first week of developing their personal projects. Students self-organize if they want to meet up at a cafe or whathaveyou to enable collaboration.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-did">What I Did</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I spent most of my time working from HR HQ when it was open. I used nearby cafes when it wasn’t.</li>
  <li>Like a few others, I used interim week to do some travelling and to catch up on sleep.</li>
  <li>At one point (maybe after interim week?), I broke my laptop by being a Linux noob. I was one of few Ubuntu users in my cohort, and I had trouble dealing with permission/access issues. I eventually followed some StackOverflow suggestion and fucked up my permissions so badly that I had to reinstall Ubuntu. As you can imagine, my emotions are still failing to heal from that self-inflicted disaster.
    <ul>
      <li>FYI, my new job is giving me a Mac. Soon I will join the majority of devs in the promise land of screens that actually reproduce accurate colors, impressive battery life, and installation wonders such as homebrew.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="extras">Extras</h2>

<ul>
  <li>In my cohort, we organized a night to go to a movie theater for Ender’s Game. Good times.</li>
  <li>A rep from <a href="http://famo.us/">Famous</a> stopped by to give a presentation about a brand new web app framework. It’s so new that even now, Famous is in beta. Back during the personal project period, it was in a closed beta (or was it alpha?), but Famous was inviting Hack Reactor students to access it! The framework renders special <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements in a breathtaking way. I never used it, but I will talk about it a bit more in another blog post.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h1>

<p>Holy. Crap. I learned so much during the personal project weeks. Admittedly, I didn’t work extra long hours until the last week or so before the deadline. By then, I was working at least 80 hours per week. In the first couple of days, I realized there was so much I had to learn that it felt quite overwhelming, and I had a difficult time starting.</p>

<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>

<p>Obviously I would have to learn a lot of app concepts, engineer some solid logic, etc. But I also had to do all this while learning new tools.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Balsamiq:</strong> Wireframing software. Creating wireframes really helps when trying to explain what you hope to build. To practice communication skills and project management, students had to explain their progress/goals very briefly during small stand-up meetings.</li>
  <li><strong>Yeoman:</strong> Boilerplate/scaffold generator. I used an Angular-Express generator to help me get started making a full-stack app with boilerplate code for Angular, Node, and Express. This served as a great “starter pack” of code.</li>
  <li><strong>Grunt:</strong> Task runner. To be honest, I used Grunt simpy because it came with Yeoman. However, gaining exposure to the tool opened my eyes to the possibilities provided by task runners like Grunt.</li>
  <li><strong>Stylus:</strong> CSS pre-processor. I’m not sure if CSS pre-processors are part of the tech stack or “just” another set of dev tools, but for what it’s worth, I didn’t write pure CSS for Co-Compare. Instead, I wrote Stylus CSS. I like the visual design side of front-end development, and using Stylus made that facet even more fun.</li>
  <li><strong>Heroku:</strong> Web app hosting provider. It’s easy to use because it follows a git workflow, but deployment still has challenges (re: environment configuration).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-tortured-ok-not-really-birth-of-an-idea">The Tortured (ok not really) Birth of An Idea</h2>

<p>I like to think my mind is superior –errr…I mean <em>creative</em>. However, it can be tough to come up with web app ideas based on constraints. Everyone worried about whether or not they could actually implement their ideas in just a few weeks (I think it amounted to only 2.5 weeks). In the end, I learned that “Just Do It” really applies. You can spend roughly 3 gajillion hours analyzing ideas, use cases, market needs, tech stacks, visual design, etc. But at some point, you need to just do it already. Just make something and see what happens. The price of failure is time spent. The gain of failure is lessons learned. A beauty of programming is the ability to quickly change, pivot, redo, etc.</p>

<h3 id="from-cool-to-meh">From Cool to Meh</h3>

<p>Originally, I thought my idea was too boring. I wanted to create a fantasy sports game specifically for tennis, but I couldn’t find a good way to get the data/stats from pro tennis matches, so I switched to something far less cool.</p>

<p>I switched to an idea spawned by my love for analyzing/comparing products and services. In the past, I’ve spent far too much time comparing video game consoles, cars, computer parts, <em>bootcamps</em>, etc. I enjoyed it too. A lot. But I knew most people aren’t crazy in this way, so I worried that my app idea for <a href="http://cocompare.herokuapp.com">Co-Compare</a> (a web app to build comparison tables and have others vote on them) was too unsexy.</p>

<h3 id="from-meh-to-oooh">From Meh to Oooh</h3>

<p>It’s true that Co-Compare doesn’t have a ton of wow-factor, but it provided plenty of opportunity:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> It was the type of idea that could work with very few features (good for rapid prototyping).</li>
  <li><strong>Exploration:</strong> But I could have fun adding more and more features as I desired. There were plenty of sub-ideas to explore and keep my brain satiated with more goodies to engineer.</li>
  <li><strong>Fundamentals:</strong> My app requires CRUD actions. Create, Read, Update, and Delete are fundamental app actions that devs should know. It’s weird to “brag” that Co-Compare helped me learn <em>fundamentals</em>, but it’s important, and it’s not easy just because it’s “fundamental.” Engineering a CRUDy app is a great learning experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Full-Stack:</strong> My app covered a lot of territory so it exposed me to CSS pre-processors, front-end MVC, API design, databases, user authentication, etc. This was really scary at first, but afterwards, I was truly proud of what I covered.</li>
</ul>

<p>I really believe that the full-stack nature of Co-Compare solidified my abilities as a web app developer. By creating a nice-looking front-end, my own API, and back-end models for a SQL datastore, I learned so much that it gave my confidence a tremendous boost –which is funny because I had a ton of confidence going into the personal project weeks…then I lost a lot of confidence when nothing I created worked the first time. So at the end, I regained a lot of confidence that I already had at the beginning.</p>

<p>Note: Some of my classmates implemented ideas that had very bare front ends because all the impressive stuff was run on the server side. Other folks created apps that had little or no back-end logic. The number of things wrong with these paths is quite small. In fact, most experts would say the number rhymes with “hero.” Anyway, my point is that this particular “full-stack” facet of my experience is not the “best” way, but just something that I really value for myself.</p>

<h2 id="dev-cycleprocess">Dev Cycle/Process</h2>

<p>Hack Reactor staff helped students with their projects by giving recommendations on tech stack decisions, dev tools, deployment options, etc. And of course, they gave us debugging help, but there was no hand holding.</p>

<p>The primary form of guidance came in the form of some project management structure. We formed small groups that held its members accountable for short-term goals. The staff taught us about iterative development and the concept of creating MVPs (minimal viable products) as milestones rather than aiming for creating versions that were 100% complete.</p>

<p>In other words, I learned about some dev processes to help promote productivity as a software engineer.</p>

<h1 id="want-to-learn-from-my-app">Want to Learn from My App?</h1>

<p>You can find the code for Co-Compare on my GitHub. I took the time to write up a decent README too because for some reason, I have a good time writing English in addition to JavaScript. I suggest you <a href="https://github.com/RebootJeff/co-compare#development">check this out</a> if you’re interested in learning more about how I created an app from scratch.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that you shouldn’t follow everything I do. For example, my Angular app folder structure neglects best practice. It was a popular structure at the time, but it’s actually best to name folders based on features, rather than just lumping all controllers together, all views together, etc.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>
  <p>Do you have any questions for me?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When an employer/recruiter asks you this question, you should answer, “YES OF COURSE I DO.” Then you casually bombard them with the questions listed below. Although, you should keep in mind that some questions can be answered just by doing your homework (researching the company). So don’t ask <em>all the questions</em>.</p>

<h1 id="company-vision">Company Vision</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Where will the company be in 2 years? (maybe “2 years” should be greater if company is older)
    <ul>
      <li>Will the business model remain the same? Is the business model still in flux?</li>
      <li>How many employees will there be in X years? What many of them will be engineers?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Does the company plan to scale up? How?
    <ul>
      <li>Increased marketing efforts?</li>
      <li>Increased R&amp;D?</li>
      <li>Growing talent?</li>
      <li>Creating partnerships?</li>
      <li>Business model pivot?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="employee-logisticsculture">Employee logistics/culture</h1>

<ul>
  <li>What are typical work hours?</li>
  <li>
    <p>How often do people actually take vacations?</p>
  </li>
  <li>What are some examples of your company’s culture in play?
    <ul>
      <li>e.g., It’s one thing to say the company is open and friendly, but what are examples of that happening?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What aspects of your company help shape the cuture?</p>
  </li>
  <li>Older/bigger companies: One of the stereotypical downsides of working at a more established company is that employees don’t feel like they have a big enough impact. How do you ensure employees can make substantive contributions rather than feel like a tiny cog in a big machine?
    <ul>
      <li>How do you ensure that employees always get to try/learn new things?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="engineering-logistics">Engineering Logistics</h1>

<ul>
  <li>How many engineers does the company have?
    <ul>
      <li>How many back-end, how many front-end, how many full-stack?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How big are the engineering teams?
    <ul>
      <li>Will team size change a lot (scaling up)?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Do employees ever change teams/roles?</li>
  <li>Exactly who would I be working with?
    <ul>
      <li>What are their roles, backgrounds, etc?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How does user feedback ultimately end up reaching the engineers?</li>
  <li>What kind of development cycle do they use?

      <li>How often do engineers deploy?</li>
      <li>Do they use Agile SCRUM, Kanban, etc?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="engineering-culture">Engineering Culture</h1>

<ul>
  <li>How does the company ensure quick, painless onboarding?
    <ul>
      <li>(does the company ensure new hires don’t get overwhelmed by huge, existing codebase?)</li>
      <li>(or is there no onboarding at all because the company is too tiny?)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Does the company have strong opinions on coding aesthetics?
    <ul>
      <li>Does the company have a style guide?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Mentorship?</li>
  <li>Are there code reviews?
    <ul>
      <li>Are they scheduled or ad hoc? (“ad hoc” may be BS for “rarely”)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Is there time set aside for post-mortems, reflections, retrospectives, etc?</li>
  <li>What kind of testing is in place?
    <ul>
      <li>(unit testing, integration testing, e2e testing, QA engineering)?</li>
      <li>which tools?</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my <a href="/blog/2013/12/26/queues-and-stacks-in-javascript/">previous post</a>, I began my quest to help noob programmers by introducing the basic computer science topic of data structures. I provided a quick overview of queues and stacks, so please read all about ‘em before engaging your eyeballs with this blog post. This time around, we’ll check out four different patterns for creating classes in JavaScript while learning how to build stacks and queues from scratch.</p>

<p>Before we go, I should warn you that I’m going to focus on describing the class instantiation patterns rather than thoroughly explaining the implementation of the data structures. Just keep in mind that we are going to explore building stacks and queues with objects rather than arrays. More specifically, we will use a property called <code>storage</code> that is an object, not an array. Now I know what you’re pondering.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is a beautiful question. Please ask it all the time (but please don’t troll me by leaving “Why?” in the comments section of this blog post). In this case, the answer to “Why?” may be a tad disatisfying. The answer is “because we can”, but don’t worry! It’ll be fun. Now, let’s start instantiating some motherhugging classes.</p>

<h1 id="functional-instantiation">1. Functional Instantiation</h1>

<p>The simplest way to implement classes is with a “maker” function that creates a new instance of the class and returns that instance so it can be stored as a variable. The new instance is just like any other JavaScript object. It can have properties that store relevant information about the instance (e.g., with a <code>Car</code> class, instances might have a <code>price</code> property). It can also have properties that store functions. These functions serve as <strong>methods</strong> that are tightly associated with the instance.</p>

<h4 id="characteristics">Characteristics</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Creates new copies of the same functions when creating a new instance of the same class. This lack of reuse takes up more memory and can leave an unsavory taste in some programmers’ mouths.</li>
  <li>There is no quick way to modify all instances of the class after they’ve been created. This will become more clear after examining the other instantiation tactics.</li>
  <li>Private variables can be created/used by harnessing <strong>closure scope</strong> superpowers, but I won’t get into that today.</li>
  <li>If you understand JavaScript functions and objects, then you can understand classes implemented via functional instantiation (other instantiation techniques require knowledge of <code>this</code> and/or <code>new</code>).</li>
  <li>Could be used to create callable instances (i.e., the class could return a function rather than an object filled with properties).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="example-code">Example code:</h4>

<h1 id="functional-instantiation-wshared-methods">2. Functional Instantiation w/Shared Methods</h1>

<p>By utilizing an object filled with methods, several classes can be created that have the same methods without creating new copies of said methods. The classes will use their own function references to refer to the same set of shared methods. Therefore, using shared methods eats up less memory than functional instantiation <em>without</em> shared methods.</p>

<h4 id="characteristics-1">Characteristics</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Reuses functions (which conserves memory) by getting function references from a utility such as <a href="http://underscorejs.org/#extend">Underscore.js</a>’s <code>_.extend(instance,methods)</code>.</li>
  <li>Retains the same benefits as functional instantiation <em>without</em> shared methods.</li>

<h1 id="prototypal-instantiation">3. Prototypal Instantiation</h1>

<p>The key to prototypal instantiation is the use of <code>Object.create()</code> to utilize shared methods. Unlike functional instantiation with shared methods, there is no need to use an <code>extend()</code> function.</p>

<p>While it’s possible to use a prototype’s functions with <code>Object.create(ExampleClass.prototype);</code>, it’s also possible to (ironically) avoid the word “prototype” altogether by using <code>Object.create(sharedMethods);</code>.</p>

<h4 id="characteristics-2">Characteristics</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Reuses shared functions via <code>Object.create(Example.prototype)</code> or <code>Object.create(objectOfFunctions)</code>.</li>
  <li>Unlike functional instantiation, function references are shared. Each instance of the class does not get its own function references that point to the shared methods. This saves even more memory (although it is a very small improvement).</li>
  <li>Unlike functional instantiation, there is no way to use closure scope to enforce privacy of variables.</li>
  <li>Variables are stored on the returned object (aka <code>instance</code>), which means the shared stack methods need to use the keyword <code>this</code> to access the necessary data. It’s not a huge bummer, but if you’re a beginner, then <code>this</code> can be a confusing concept.</li>
  <li>Can use prototype chains for dynamic method modification and inheritance (subclasses!).</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="pseudoclassical-instantiation">4. Pseudoclassical Instantiation</h1>

<p>This is the most commonly used class pattern. It’s also the most complicated because, in addition to using the <code>this</code> keyword, it involves two concepts that the other class patterns don’t require: the <code>new</code> keyword and prototypes. Prototypal instantiation uses prototypes via <code>Object.create()</code>, but pseudoclassical instantiation needs you to explicitly type out <code>ClassName.prototype.methodName</code>, which is just another source of confusion for beginners.</p>

<p>Also, it’s the only class pattern that uses a true <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructor_(object-oriented_programming)">constructor</a> for creating new instances. Other class patterns use instantiator functions that explicitly return a new instance. The pseudoclassical class pattern does not perform such a return thanks to the <code>new</code> keyword.</p>

<h4 id="characteristics-3">Characteristics</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Uses prototype chains to provide methods to instances of a class.</li>
  <li>Allows for dynamic method modification and inheritance (subclasses!) via prototype chains.</li>
  <li>Refers to the instance that’s being created with the <code>this</code> keyword.</li>
  <li>Needs the <code>new</code> keyword to make an instance of a class.</li>
  <li>Has a true constructor that is named with a noun rather than a verb. The name is capitalized.</li>
  <li>Is the most commonly used class pattern.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The proverbial “they” say (says?) it’s good to write technical blog posts. Blog posts that get down and dirty with the nitty gritty of low-level, in-the-weeds details and nuances accompanied by jargon, acronyms, and name-dropping are all the rage in the dev community. More importantly, I really want to help beginners learn programming, so I may as well teach some basic concepts via my blog. (Later on, I hope to contribute more to <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>, which is a free, open-source, online resource for beginners created by a very cool individual.)</p>

<p>So as my first foray in technical blog posts, I present to all loveable noobs: the introductory data structures known as stacks and queues.</p>

<h1 id="whats-a-stack">What’s a Stack?</h1>

<p>A stack is a collection of items (or data) that follow a particular rule: the last item to join the collection is the first one to leave.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <strong>L</strong>ast data <strong>I</strong>n is the <strong>F</strong>irst data <strong>O</strong>ut (<strong>LIFO</strong>)</li>
  <li>Add data: <strong>push</strong></li>
  <li>Remove data: <strong>pop</strong></li>
  <li>Data enters and exits at the same end of the stack (at the <strong>top</strong>)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="simple-implementation">Simple implementation</h2>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption class="code-header" style="margin-bottom:-5px;"><span>Simple Stack (array-based example)</span><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1590247/how-do-you-implement-a-stack-and-a-queue-in-javascript">Stack Overflow </a></figcaption> <div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
<span class="keyword">var</span> stack = [];
stack.push(<span class="integer">1</span>);  <span class="comment">// use the push method provided by the Array prototype</span>

stack.push(<span class="integer">3</span>);
console.log(stack);  <span class="comment">// output: [1,2,3]</span>

<span class="keyword">var</span> popped = stack.pop();  <span class="comment">// use the pop method provided by the Array prototype</span>
console.log(popped);  <span class="comment">// output: 3</span>
console.log(stack);  <span class="comment">// output: [1,2]</span>

<h2 id="ridiculous-analogy">Ridiculous analogy</h2>

<p>Imagine you’ve found an old, abandoned well. You think to yourself, “Bruce Wayne fell down a well when he was a kid, and I wanna be just like the Batman, so I’m gonna fall down this sweet well!” But you hesitate because …it’s a well, and wells are scary, ya know?</p>

<p>Unbeknownst to you, <a href="http://batman.wikia.com/wiki/Harley_Quinn">your arch-nemesis</a> is out walking her <a href="http://batman.wikia.com/wiki/Bud_and_Lou">pet hyenas</a>. She spots you, and quickly runs over to shove you into the well. She giggles in delight at the sight of your plight. She then hides and waits for more people to walk near the well so she can <strong>push</strong> them too.</p>

<p>It just so happens that this well has the diameter of a single person’s width. When someone is pushed into the well, they land on top of the last person who fell in before them. This creates a <strong>stack</strong> of people and some rather pronounced discomfort. Eventually, there are 5 people in this deep-yet-thin well, and you decide it’s time to call for help to get rescued.</p>

<p>To your disappointment, the not-so-dark knight named Superman arrives to pull you well-dwellers out (one at a time). The last one pushed into the well is the first to <strong>pop</strong> out. <em>LIFO.</em></p>

<h1 id="whats-a-queue">What’s a Queue?</h1>

<p>A queue is a collection of items (or data) that follow the real-life “rules” of waiting in a line of people: the first item to join the collection is the first one to leave the collection.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <strong>F</strong>irst data <strong>I</strong>n is the <strong>F</strong>irst data <strong>O</strong>ut (<strong>FIFO</strong>)</li>
  <li>Add data: <strong>enqueue</strong></li>
  <li>Remove data: <strong>dequeue</strong></li>
  <li>Data exits at the: <strong>head</strong> of the queue</li>
  <li>Data enters at the: <strong>tail</strong> of the queue</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="simple-implementation-1">Simple implementation</h2>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption class="code-header" style="margin-bottom:-5px;"><span>Simple Queue (array-based example)</span><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1590247/how-do-you-implement-a-stack-and-a-queue-in-javascript">Stack Overflow </a></figcaption> <div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
<span class="keyword">var</span> queue = [];

console.log(queue);  <span class="comment">// output: [1,2,3]</span>

<span class="keyword">var</span> dequeued = queue.shift();  <span class="comment">// &quot;dequeue&quot;</span>

console.log(queue);  <span class="comment">// output: [2,3]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
 </figure></notextile></div>

<h2 id="ridiculous-analogy-1">Ridiculous analogy</h2>

<p>Batman decides to do some in-the-field combat training. He drops into the middle of a gang meeting and yells, “I’ve sent your buddies to jail. I know you want revenge. Catch me if you can. P.S. I’m Batman!” Why does the cowled hero do this? We all know Batman is a smart dude, and sure enough, he has a clever plan. He lures the baddies who are running after him into a narrow alley.</p>

<p>The gangsters can only approach Batman one at a time to fit in the narrow alley, so they form a line (aka <strong>queue</strong>). The gangster at the front of the line is the first gangster knocked out (aka <strong>dequeued</strong>) by Batman (<strong>first in; first out</strong>). You might even say that Batman’s fists aim for the <strong>head</strong> of the queue and foolish gangsters enter at the <strong>tail</strong> of the line of doom.</p>

<h1 id="the-story-will-continue">The Story Will Continue</h1>

<p>Stay tuned for more blog posts on data structures. My next technical blog post will examine how to implement stacks and queues from scratch (without arrays) to get a deeper understanding of push, pop, enqueue, and dequeue. I know you can’t wait for the moment I deliver on this promise. I can hear your panting through my WiFi, but please stay patient. I was busy working on a <a href="https://github.com/RebootJeff/cocompare">web app</a> and then a <a href="https://github.com/RebootJeff/phone-tag-phonegap">mobile app</a>. Now, I’m busy with job searching while possibly starting mini-project.</p>

<p>On a mildly amusing, unrelated note: isn’t it funny to think about the phrase “stay tuned”? It’s getting rather archaic now that terrestrial, over-the-air TV and radio are losing popularity. Yes, these are the random things I think about as I write blog posts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My previous blog post was nearly 3 weeks ago. Why? What’s stopped me from posting more stories of life at Hack Reactor? For the past several days, I have been working on an individual project. I was very confident going into it, and I should eventually blog specifically about the initial stages, but as it turned out …there is a crap-ton of stuff to juggle when developing a web app. There are so many things that can go wrong in your workflow –not just in your code.</p>

<h1 id="things-that-kept-me-busy">Things That Kept me Busy</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Defaut installation of node/npm on Ubuntu led to file permissions issues. Oh shit.</li>
  <li>Figuring out Yeoman: Before <code>npm install -g yo</code>: I wonder what will happen. After <code>yo generator-angularexpress</code>: What is all this stuff?! Oh nice.</li>
  <li>Figuring out Grunt: How can I get it to work with Stylus? Oh nice.</li>
  <li>Easy, but time-consuming (to make sure you don’t break something that used to work)
    <ul>
      <li>Organizing files/folders in a professional way (inter-file <code>require</code> statements can break)</li>
      <li>Using environment variables (typos can be devastating)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Facebook Authorization
    <ul>
      <li>Making 2 FB apps (one for dev environment; one for production environment)</li>
      <li>Figuring out the proper callback URL</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Databases
    <ul>
      <li>Juggling MySQL in development environment, then switching to PostgreSQL in production.</li>
      <li>Why is the production database getting flooded? Oh there’s a random configuration setting I missed in Sequelize.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Random Heroku hiccups (at one point, a node module provider went down, causing Heroku’s <code>npm install</code> to die).</li>
</ul>

<p>These are just a few of the little obstacles that add up. You don’t see them coming. They take quite a bit of time to hunt down.</p>

<p class="my-caption">Good morning</p>

<p>No more sprints! I’m both sad and relieved. The sprints have provided enough structure to ensure a guided education thus far. They’ve equipped me with enough skill to yield the self-belief that I can actually build a complete web app …which is good because that’s exactly what I’m going to do starting this week. Looking back on week 5 makes me think I might miss the relative safety of paired programming, but I’m pumped to be diving into my own project.</p>

<p>By the way, this blog post is really long. I think I’m going to split up future blog posts, and I’m going to post more frequently.</p>

<h1 id="recap-of-events">Recap of Events</h1>

<h3 id="alumni-panel">Alumni Panel</h3>

<p>Early in the week, there was a truly invaluable guest speaker event. Six Hack Reactor alumni held a Q&amp;A session with current students. One alumnus is a Hacker-in-Residence at Hack Reactor. His role is a paid, part-time, short-term job supporting the school. There are a handful of Hacker-in-Residences at HackR at any given time. After their stints, they are put through the same job finding process that students who didn’t want to become a Resident normally go through.</p>

<p>The other five alumni were from Adap.tv, Adobe, DocuSign, Edmodo, and Versal, respectively. They had a variety of roles including smartphone app development, front-end MVC engineering, internal QA, data visualization, and full-stack development. I have to admit that I was a bit judgemental about the QA role at first, but it actually sounded legit by the end of the Q&amp;A session. For what it’s worth, the Adap.tv guy was hired even though he doesn’t have a college degree! In my opinion, that’s awesome, and it really says a lot about the meritocracy found in the tech job market (…or the non-traditional, new-school nature of the Bay Area).</p>

<p>There was a ton of insight gleaned from the alumni panel. Examples of advice include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ask employers about their onboarding process (smaller companies might not have one, and that can be a turn-off for some newbies).</li>
  <li>Invest in social capital. Wow, that was a really buzzwordy sentence so let me translate: get to know your co-workers. “Ask them out” to coffee breaks, happy hours, lunches, etc. This may sound like basic networking at first, but I think the point is that in software development, you’re going to be asking others for help quite a lot, so it’s good to build a rapport ASAP to make asking for assistance as natural as possible. This is something I never really considered before, but after all the paired programming I’ve done at Hack Reactor, it makes a ton of sense to establish rapports that foster collaborative vibes.</li>
  <li>Ask employers to set up a meeting between you and your potential boss. It’s ok –this is totally ok. I used to work in an industry where this would never really be possible, so I had to ask if this is ok after one alumnus mentioned how one of his prioties when job hunting was to find a cool boss. I want a cool boss too!</li>
  <li>NEVER make the first move for salary negotiations. Let them make an offer before you start specifying any numbers.</li>
  <li>Specific to HackR: Don’t be too eager to accept your first job offer. You will get more. Shop around. It’s tempting to accept your first or second job offer just because employment is such a major goal when deciding to join Hack Reactor in the first place. However, joining Hack Reactor isn’t something you do just to get a job –it’s something you do to get an <em>ideal</em> job.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sorry, but I forgot to take thorough notes during the alumni panel, so the list above is rather short.</p>

<h3 id="more-guest-speakers">More Guest Speakers</h3>

<p>Now might be a good time to point out that Hack Reactor has guest speakers at least one evening per week. Attendance is optional. Oftentimes students choose to work on their assignments/projects at the workstations rather than stay in the lecture area to listen to the guest speaker.</p>

<p>What’s my point? This week was the first time I didn’t really have enough time to fully invest in the guest speakers. Rudely, I’ve forgotten that names of the speakers, but one guy spoke about databases (i.e., engineering decisions you might face when designing/creating/maintaining/scaling a database) and another guy (from Khan Academy) spoke about <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>, the JavaScript library written and open-sourced by Facebook. Relevant link: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW0rj4sNH2w">React presented at JSConf</a></p>

<h3 id="picking-personal-projects">Picking Personal Projects</h3>

<p>To be honest, I wasn’t thrilled with the way HackR arranged the transition from sprints to personal projects. Students were under the impression that we’d get more support/attention for coming up with project ideas, but we weren’t given much time to brainstorm. Instead of dedicating a lecture to a guided brainstorming session, students had to come up with ideas in their spare time (which is tough when busy worrying about Ruby and Angular for the sprints).</p>

<h3 id="social-night-haunted-house">Social Night: Haunted House</h3>

<p>Once again, I did not attend social night. On one hand, I feel bad that my cohort has generally had low participation in the weekly social nights. On the other hand, the consensus seems to be that the social nights just don’t feel all that appealing. The first one was awesome; the others were “meh.”</p>

<p>Instead of going to the Social Night event last Saturday, I went to a nice happy hour/dinner with a few other students. Afterwards, I went back to HackR to continue tackling client-side user authentication with my Angular sprint partner. We failed, but we got a lot of other stuff done during the day, so I felt ok about the sprint as a whole. Plus, my partner and I established a fun rapport so even failing to get “auth” working was a funny time.</p>

<h1 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h1>

<p>Week 5 included assignments for building a URL shortening web app to further improve students’ full-stack skills.</p>

<h3 id="ruby-sinatra-activerecord-sqlite">Ruby, Sinatra, ActiveRecord, SQLite</h3>

<p>Server-side code used a lot of Ruby and Sinatra. HackR chose not to teach us students Ruby on Rails (RoR) because Sinatra is simpler than Rails. It’s easy to be bummed about this, but in hindsight, I’m not worried about it. Yes, Rails is a big deal right now in Silicon Valley, but I’m under the impression that RoR was embraced because of it’s great for rapid prototyping. Times are changing though. There are now more options for rapid prototyping. More importantly, I’m at the point in my HackR-guided education where I have built up enough fundamental know-how to make me confident that I can learn RoR later.</p>

<p>For now, it’s more important to learn concepts about MVC/MV* development, user authentication, databases, etc. Speaking of databases, there isn’t much for me to say about SQLite because students were harnessing ActiveRecord magic to manipulate a simple SQLite database with only two tables. We had to use <a href="https://github.com/cldwalker/tux">tux</a> to do database probing, which is slightly less convenient than using MySQL’s terminal interface (as we did in the previous week).</p>

<h3 id="angular">Angular</h3>

<p>The students were pretty hyped up to learn Angular as our final sprint. We’ve invested a lot of time into learning Backbone, but word on the street (a really nerdy street) is that Angular is the “new hotness” that will take over the world of front-end JavaScript for single-page web apps.</p>

<p>Overall, I think the students’ reception of Angular was torn. Some love the power (Angular’s data-binding is pretty addicting); some find discomfort in the need to learn some rather bizarre syntax (Angular forces you to write HTML with “directives”).</p>

<p>Here’s the low down: Backbone feels like the traditional, familiar option whereas Angular feels like the more experimental, exotic option. Yes, it took us awhile to appreciate Backbone, but once we got comfortable with it, we realized how easy it is to comprehend after you get your mind around it.</p>

<p>For Angular, the learning curve is a lot less steep, but it also seems like it will be harder to master. There is more “magic” …and now I’m realizing I should explain that word.</p>

<h4 id="aside-what-is-magic">Aside: What is “magic”?</h4>

<p>When I say “magic,” I’m using it colloquially to refer to abstraction that feels harder to comprehend and feels less intuitive. For analogy*, a door knob abstracts mechanical bits. You may not be a locksmith, but it’s probably easy for a child to imagine how it works. Even as a child, you probably had some intuition that door knobs just have some simple mechanism for converting rotational movement of the knob into longitudinal movement of the latch On the other hand, it’s a bit hard for a child to imagine how a digital camera works. Even an old-school film-based camera feels magical at that tender age when you’re first capable of comprehending door knobs. Ahhh…those were the days, am I right?</p>

<p><strong>*By the way, can we make “for analogy” a thing in the same way that “for example” is a thing?</strong></p>

<p>Also, if you google “parts of a door knob,” you will see some complex diagrams, but I will defend my analogy! For the sake of argument, let’s just say door knobs use simple cams.</p>

<h4 id="back-to-my-thoughts-on-angular">Back to my thoughts on Angular</h4>

<p>So why does Angular seem so magical? By using Angular’s library of directives, you can have the browser display a list of items without writing DOM-manipulating code (i.e., jQuery). You can sort those items without writing a sorting function. You can filter those items without writing a sorting function. In Angular, you’re not supposed to use jQuery to change/update the HTML on the page. Angular takes care of that for you. How does it do that? Magic (directives). I haven’t even touched Angular’s feature that allows you to just create your own semantic HTML tags (e.g., <code>&lt;tab&gt;&lt;pane&gt;Content for Pane 1&lt;/pane&gt;&lt;pane&gt;Content for Pane 2&lt;/pane&gt;&lt;/tab&gt;</code>).</p>

<h3 id="routers-templates-user-authentication">Routers, Templates, User Authentication</h3>

<p>With MVC frameworks comes routers and templates. With web apps comes user authentication (sometimes).</p>

<p>On the server-side, routing involves RESTful APIs, which are fairly tidy interfaces that allow clients to talk to servers. On the client-side, routing involves flow control and updating the URL in the browser address bar so that it looks pretty/semantic. For example, you may want to switch to an editing panel when the user clicks a button. The router changes the URL to end in <code>/edit</code> without causing the page to refresh. The router also calls a function that might do edit-related things such as rendering an editing panel.</p>

<p>Templates are used to create sections of HTML that will contain dynamic content. Let’s say you want to render an unordered list (<code>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</code>), and the app will determine how many items (<code>&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</code>) will be in the list. Templates take care of that.</p>

<p>On the server-side, routing and templating is pretty easy with Sinatra. On the client-side, routing with Angular feels easier than routing with Backbone. Templates are way easier in Angular for me.</p>

<p>In any case, I find user authentication isn’t very straightforward, but I haven’t tried many gems for Ruby nor <a href="http://passportjs.org/">Passport</a> for Node.js. You need to check for authentication, redirect visitors as necessary, encrypt passwords (AND usernames –don’t forget that), save login info into a database, manage sessions/cookies, etc. A surprising amount of mistakes can be made.</p>

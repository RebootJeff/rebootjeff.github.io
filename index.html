  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don’t know if <a href="blog/2013/09/29/hackr-diary-thoughts-about-week-number-1/">my summary of week #1</a> made it clear or not, but although my first six days at Hack Reactor were tough, I didn’t exactly struggle with any of the material. This is probably because the pre-course work was <a href="/blog/2013/09/22/hackr-diary-pre-course-anticipation/">incredibly difficult</a>, thereby infusing me with helpful knowledge while also shaping my expectations.</p>

<p>Well guess what? Week 1 was an anomaly. It was a week filled with more lectures and less hands-on programming. I knew this ahead of time, but week 2 still caught me off guard. There was quite a bit more learning with minimal guidance. Also, the joys/stresses of pair programming are turned up a few notches as a result of the additional programming time created by reducing the amount of lecture time.</p>

<p>Consequently, I’ve been feeling more tired in general. Forgive me, but spending my free time to write this blog is beginning to look less and less appealing.</p>

<p>I joined a nearby gym (aside: I just remembered that I need to notify Hack Reactor to get my $50 reimbursement from them!) so my energy levels should increase in a week or two. Every other lunch break is two hours long instead of just one hour long. The extra time is meant to encourage students to go exercise.</p>

<p>I want to write more about student life at Hack Reactor, but I think I’ll just spread out the details in my <a href="/blog/categories/hackr-diary/">HackR Diary</a> series rather than providing every bit of info in a single, giant blog post. So for now, I cover gym time, toy problems, and tapouts. In the future, I’ll discuss the workstations, help system, student-staff interaction, food, and more.</p>

<h1 id="week-in-review">Week in Review</h1>

<h4 id="toy-problems">Toy Problems</h4>

<p>This week, my cohort, the junior students, started solving (almost) daily toy problems, which are small coding challenges designed to get us used to the type of timed problems that will be thrown our way at tech interviews. We have to complete these problems individually. We have 30-60 minutes to think of a solution, code the solution, and submit pull requests to have an automated tester give us feedback that we can use to help fix our solutions as necessary.</p>

<h4 id="tapouts">Tapouts</h4>

<p>This week, us juniors also started attending weekly(?) tapouts. Tapouts are like small group therapy sessions where five students voice their opinions of Hack Reactor to an alumnus. She will send anonimized feedback up the chain while also providing us with advice for any struggles we care to talk about. </p>

<h4 id="special-event-airbnb-presentation">Special Event: AirBnB Presentation</h4>

<p>Lead devs from <a href="https://twitter.com/Airbnb">AirBnB</a> presented a ton of info about their tech stack, their work environment, <a href="http://nerds.airbnb.com/weve-open-sourced-rendr-run-your-backbonejs-a/">their open source project</a>, dev career advice, startup advice, etc. There was a post-presentation panel for answering a several questions. Then there was a post-panel meet-and-greet session. It was a truly fantastic event.</p>

<h4 id="saturday-social-night">Saturday Social Night</h4>

<p>I skipped last Saturday’s social night to go to a close friend’s birthday celebration(s). Week 2’s theme for social night was board/card games.</p>

<h1 id="what-i-learned--what-i-thought">What I Learned + What I Thought</h1>

<h4 id="inheritancesubclassing-in-javascript">Inheritance/Subclassing in JavaScript</h4>

<p>The subclassing sprint was a bit frustrating at first. It took me awhile to grasp the keyword <code>this</code> because of JavaScript’s tendency to pass functions around as parameters to other functions.</p>

<p>Upon wrapping one’s brain around <code>this</code> (and the <code>.call()</code>/<code>.apply()</code> methods), there was a lot of fun to be had with the assignment that Hack Reactor gave the students. This was the first assignment involving a visual facet, and the student body reacted accordingly (with creativity galore).</p>

<h4 id="algorithms">Algorithms</h4>

<p>The algorithms sprint was a fantastic challenge, but there was no specific set of knowledge to learn. It felt like the main goal of the sprint was to get students’ minds thinking in more computer-oriented ways. We were taught some basics about time complexity, but we didn’t go into much depth about Big-O notation. We briefly described actions (e.g., deleting data from an array) and algorithms (e.g., solutions to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle#Related_problems">n-queens puzzle</a>) as constant, linear, quadratic, polynomial, and exponential (as opposed to discussing the nuances of O(c), O(n), O(n^2), O(n^c), O(c^n), etc).</p>

<p>The main takeaway was that we should worry more about macro optimizations (storing data in variables in a way that allows for constant-time lookup) rather than micro optimizations (improving a <code>for</code> loop so then it loops fewer times). <strong>Micro optimizations are good, but they aren’t very valuable when you’re just creating prototypes, minimum viable products, etc.</strong></p>

<p>I’m somewhat disappointed that we weren’t taught specific algorithms such as quicksort, binary search, etc. I’m under the assumption that all software developers need to know the “greatest hits” of algorithms. Although, I’m also under the assumption that such knowledge is more useful in tech interviews than in day-to-day coding.</p>

<h4 id="layoutpositioning-htmlcss">Layout/Positioning (HTML/CSS)</h4>

<p>I taught myself a decent amount of HTML/CSS before my cohort’s start date, so I was very comfortable with the layout assignment, but it wasn’t easy. There are still plenty of times when proper CSS positioning eludes me. That said, this topic doesn’t provide an intellectual challenge.</p>

<p>The difficulty lies in getting the syntax just right and understanding hierarchy. Some students didn’t learn much HTML/CSS before joining Hack Reactor, and so they had a lot to learn (box model, DOM hierarchy, CSS selectors, etc.) in a very short amount of time.</p>

<p><strong>If you’re thinking of joining Hack Reactor as a student, I highly recommend you teach yourself HTML/CSS</strong> ahead of time. HTML/CSS isn’t tought to learn on your own, but it can be time-consuming even if you’ve got pros helping you. You may as well prepare yourself so then you can spend less time at Hack Reactor worrying about HTML/CSS and more time worrying about other technologies and concepts.</p>

<h4 id="d3-library">D3 (library)</h4>

<p><a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> is a JavaScript library for creating data-driven visuals inside HTML documents. I thought jQuery was cool, but now I think D3 takes the cake. It’s much harder to learn D3, but there is tremendous power to be had from familiarizing yourself with it.</p>

<p>That said, the D3 assignment left me mentally tired as hell. Like jQuery, you can easily select DOM elements, but the rest of the D3 syntax isn’t so straightforward, and the general concepts for using D3 properly will feel rather foreign at first. I hope to spend more time on my own to master D3 …when I’m not so damn tired. The key is to understand the <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3808218">general update pattern</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Good way to start week 2 at <a href="https://twitter.com/HackReactor">@HackReactor</a> <a href="http://t.co/6pB80gQKCO">pic.twitter.com/6pB80gQKCO</a></p>&mdash; Jeff Lee (@RebootJeff) <a href="https://twitter.com/RebootJeff/statuses/384728991359176704">September 30, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p>This post is a bit late, but it can be hard to find time to write up a thorough blog post when I’m studying at Hack Reactor for 70-80 hours/week. During my free time, it’s tempting to just play <a href="http://www.playhawken.com">Hawken</a> or catch up on YouTube (yes, I subscribe to some damn good channels).</p>

<p>Quick correction: In <a href="">my previous HackR Diary entry</a>, I said that the staff gets a 1-week vacation every 7 weeks (6 weeks of work followed by a 1-week break). This isn’t entirely true. The interim week can be used as vacation, but staff also use it to make changes to Hack Reactor. For example, the most recent interim week was used by staff to rearrange the lecture room, which involved installing a new projector screen.</p>

<h1 id="week-in-review">Week in Review</h1>

<p>I wake up everyday Mon-Sat at 7:30am. I should really wake up earlier so then I can arrive before 8:50am. I rely on the BART (subway) to get to/from Hack Reactor. I make my subway rides more enjoyable by saving YouTube videos as .mp4 files to my phone. I generally watch documentaries on cosmology and nature featuring British narrators. The accent is key. If you’re interested in such documentaries, <strong>check out <a href="http://science-documentaries.com/">this link</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ag0U65NkxrI&amp;feature=share&amp;list=PL300BF5A42D3C21C4">this link</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Ok enough of that. You came here to read about the intersection of start-up life and student life, not BBC on YouTube. Here’s a quick recap of what I was up to last week:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Learning:</strong> 2 “standard” sprints + 1 longer sprint</li>
  <li><strong>Reflection:</strong> Provided feedback on what students did and didn’t like about week 1.</li>
  <li><strong>Week 0 self-assessment:</strong> An ungraded quiz to force you to ask yourself how confident you are about what was taught in the pre-course work.</li>
  <li><strong>Code Review by seniors:</strong> The “upperclassmen” took a look at our data structures solutions.</li>
  <li><strong>Social Night:</strong> Visited <em>House of Air</em>, a sweet trampoline gym.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h1>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sprint #1:</strong> Recursion</li>
  <li><strong>Sprint #2:</strong> Mini-clone of Underscore.js</li>
  <li><strong>Extra #1:</strong> Advice for Success

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="what-i-thought">What I Thought</h1>

<h2 id="lectures">Lectures</h2>

<p><strong>Week 1 is very different from most weeks</strong> due to the amount of lengthy lectures we have to sit through, but ya know what? I really liked the lectures. The main instructor for week 1 is Marcus, and he’s pretty great at teaching. Students constantly ask questions during lecture so it feels much more interactive and much less like being force-fed information.</p>

<p>I like that lectures involve plenty of analogies, live coding examples, industry best practices, and “every interviewer will ask you about this” moments. You’d think students would get pretty tired of all the lectures, but they’re too good to be off-putting. Also, 5+ hours of lectures per day isn’t a lot when you consider we’re spending 12+ hours per day at the school.</p>

<h2 id="paired-programming">Paired Programming</h2>

<p>I generally like the idea of paired programming so long as you have a good dynamic with your partner. That said, it can be <em>really</em> tiring because you’re constantly talking as you and your partner are coding. Not only are you exhausting your brain’s cognitive abilities by working on programming challenges, but you’re also exercising verbal comm skills and listening skills. It can be tough to listen to your partner explain his/her solution when you feel like you’re on the brink of working out your own awesome solution in your head.</p>

<h2 id="the-school">The School</h2>

<p>Hack Reactor is a fantastic environment, and I know every student of every bootcamp says this, but it’s just so amazing to be in a school where the students and teachers are all so pumped to be there. On top of that, the students are open-minded without being naive. Basically, <strong>Hack Reactor is filled with the positive vibes that should make every college wildly jealous.</strong></p>

<p>It’s also worth noting that Hack Reactor is transparent. They’re a small company, and their small size allows them to build a tighter community of teachers, students, and alumni. I love that Hack Reactor staff is very honest and genuine. When cynics look at the relatively expensive tuition, it’s tempting for them to say HackR is “in it for the money,” but check out a lecture or listen to them explain their intentions and you won’t hear a sales pitch. You’ll hear earnest intentions to educate the next generation of developers using next-generation methods.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p class="last-updated">Last updated on Sep 28, 2013 to edit section on guard operator.</p>

<p>It’s the end of day #3. I don’t have much time to write, so this blog post is a smattering of thoughts from a fresh Hack Reactor student.</p>

<h1 id="initial-observations">Initial Observations</h1>

<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Day 1 and 2 are just review days covering topics and challenges covered by the pre-course work. Day 1 covered ettiquette, expectations, and recursion. Day 2 covered passing functions, a lot of JS fundamentals, and awesome advice for being successful (e.g., we talked about impostor syndrome, Hack Reactor’s motivations, some job-hunting advice, etc).</li>
  <li>Day 3 covered paired programming, object-oriented programming (OOP), and classes (e.g., functional instantiation vs. prototypal instantiation vs. psuedoclassical instantiation).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="logistics">Logistics</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Week 1 is full of lectures. Each day is about 50% lectures, 50% coding.</li>
  <li>The first 6 weeks will have plenty of lectures and structured challenges. Then there is an interim week where you work on a project from home, which gives you the flexibility to travel, but the Hack Reactor staff will be offline (they basically get a 1-week vacation every 7 weeks). After the interim week is more time for your individual project, time for a group project, and time for job prep.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="nuances">Nuances</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Lunch breaks and dinner breaks are often cut short due to lectures running long.</li>
  <li>Lectures run long due to people asking questions.</li>
  <li>All teachers advocate for students to ask questions. At Hack Reactor, the students ask a TON of questions because the class atmosphere is very comfortable.</li>
  <li>The students are really nice. Everyone’s excited to meet new people (even the quiet ones are clearly motivated to be social).</li>
  <li>I’ve heard stories of students of other bootcamps going out at night to hang out and have fun. I could be wrong, but so far it seems like there’s no time/energy left for going out at night.</li>
  <li>That said, students don’t stay here that late (so far). A lot of us leave by 9pm. I thought it’d be common to leave no earlier than 10pm, but there aren’t even that many students from the senior cohort by the time the clock strikes 9:20pm (which is the latest I’ve stayed). I have a feeling this will change in a few weeks (beause that will be crunch time for the senior cohort).</li>
  <li>Nothing’s perfect. Some equipment is broken, some chairs are shitty, some online resources are buggy, etc. None of these issues have been big issues.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="nuggets-of-knowledge">Nuggets of Knowledge</h1>

<p>I’ve picked up a lot of cool (and oftentimes valuable) advice/facts in just 3 days.</p>

<h2 id="life-nuggets">Life Nuggets</h2>

<h3 id="re-education">Re: <strong>Education</strong></h3>

<p>Passive learning is deceptively similar to true understanding. When you just observe a correct solution, it can give you the illusion that you learned more than you really did. For example, you might watch someone code up a good solution. When you walk away, you’ll think you understand everything necessary to solve the problem, but all you learned was some code without its meaning.</p>

<h3 id="re-starting-a-new-tech-career">Re: <strong>Starting a new tech career</strong></h3>

<p>Everyone thinks starting a new tech career with a tiny startup is really exciting. That might be true, but people tend to forget an important caveat: less structure could lead to a less efficient roadmap to individual success.</p>

<p>In less formal terms, you might work for a tiny startup on something you truly care about, but the startup could easily be too small or too young to provide an environment with superiors/peers that can help you develop your programming skills (or any job-related skills).</p>

<h3 id="guard-operator">Guard operator</h3>

<p>Marcus, the primary instructor, warned us that some devs dislike the guard operator, but it’s really concise (which is cool to him). The guard operator is a logical-AND or logical-OR that “guards” a small bit of code the same way an <code>if</code> statement would guard it. For example:</p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">if</span>(goodStudent === <span class="predefined-constant">true</span>){
    candy++;
}

<span class="comment">// The above code could be refactored into the following:</span>
goodStudent &amp;&amp; candy++;
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The following is a more practical example:</p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="comment">// Let's say you want to only call a function with an array if the array is NOT undefined (i.e., you want to guard against a scenario where you pass an undefined argument to a function).</span>
arg &amp;&amp; myFunction(arg);
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>You can also use a logical-OR in a guard-like fashion. This is sometimes called the <strong>default operator</strong> rather than a guard operator.</p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="comment">// if no name was passed into the function, just give the name variable a default value of 'friend'</span>

<span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="function">sayHello</span> = <span class="keyword">function</span>(name){
  <span class="keyword">if</span>(name === <span class="predefined-constant">undefined</span>){
    name = <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">friend</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>;
  }
  console.log(<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">Hello, </span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span> + name + <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">!</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>);
}

<span class="comment">// the function above could be refactored to use the OR-guard as follows:</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="function">sayHello</span> = <span class="keyword">function</span>(name){
  name = name || <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">friend</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>;
  console.log(<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">Hello, </span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span> + name + <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">!</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>);
}
</pre></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/20130922/mytwittler.png" alt="Thumbnail of my twittler" /></p>

<p class="my-caption">Thumbnail of my Twitter clone assignment</p>

<p>Tomorrow is a huge day for me. Tomorrow is when <a href="/blog/2013/08/25/hack-reactor-is-my-future/">I start attending Hack Reactor</a>. I’m about to go from funemployment (going to bed at 4am; waking up at 12pm) to immersive student life (spending 80 hours/week on “campus”). I will write about my journey from amateur to trained pro in a series of blog posts called <a href="/blog/categories/hackr-diary/">HackR Diary</a>.</p>

<h1 id="mandatory-pre-course-work">Mandatory Pre-Course Work</h1>
<p>I enrolled in tomorrow’s Hack Reactor cohort back in late August. So I had a month to get through some pre-course “homework.” Some bits of the homework were harder than I expected (e.g., functional JavaScript challenges); some bits were easier than I expected (e.g., creation of simple Twitter-like front-end). The Twitter clone challenge was actually really fun for me because I like a challenge that actually includes a front-end.</p>

<p>There were times I was frustrated because I felt like I would be doing a lot better with just a little bit of help (e.g., recursion challenges), but I didn’t ask for much help, so I did a lot of solo struggling. However, one of the biggest bummers was going through the Backbone.js assignment. The assignment was to simply complete the <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/anatomy-of-backbonejs">Code School Backbone.js tutorials</a> (two of them). <strong>Hack Reactor provided me with a Code School membership</strong>, and I was excited to take advantage of it, but that particular set of Code School tutorials isn’t very good at teaching. I felt like I didn’t get a good grip of the concepts (models/collections, views/rendering, routers).</p>

<p>I’m also a bit jaded when it comes to online tutorials. They generally do a lot of hand-holding to the point where you don’t retain much info, and if you get stuck on something, you’re a bit screwed. <strong>My low patience for tutorials is part of why I decided to enroll in a bootcamp, but there I was: doing tutorials as part of bootcamp homework!</strong> Don’t get me wrong, online tutorials are great resources in general, but I can only take so much. Eventually, I’d rather do some <a href="http://www.coderbyte.com/">Coderbyte</a> challenges instead of Code School challenges.</p>

<h1 id="pre-course-check-in-meeting">Pre-Course Check-In Meeting</h1>
<p>Hack Reactor makes incoming students meet with a Hacker-in-Residence (basically a Teaching Assitant?) to check up on the pre-course homework. I heard that some students have been weeded out of the bootcamp by the homework.</p>

<p>I met with an H-in-R named <a href="http://thishackergirl.wordpress.com/">Bianca</a>. My meeting was done in person, but these check-in meetings are sometimes conducted via webcam for those who haven’t arrived in San Francisco yet.</p>

<p>Before the meeting, I was pretty worried about how I stacked up compared to my peers. We’re not experts (hence the desire to enroll in a bootcamp), but we’re supposed to be much better than a typical beginner because <a href="/blog/2013/09/15/coding-bootcamp-research-admissions-part2/#hack-reactor-wants-to-kick-your-ass">the admissions process was not easy</a>. During the meeting, Bianca asked me how I felt about the three biggest parts of the pre-course homework: the functional JavaScript challenge involving test-driven development (TDD), the rudimentary Twitter front-end clone, and the JSON recursion challenges.</p>

<p>I anxiously watched as Bianca scrolled through my code. After discussing some questions I had, issues I struggled with, and solutions to my few bugs, I felt a lot better. Maybe I put too much pressure on myself, but I tend to worry a lot. <strong>I walked out of the conference room feeling very positive.</strong></p>

<h1 id="other-pre-course-work">Other Pre-Course Work</h1>
<p>Hack Reactor suggests completing more tutorials and reading some resources if students have some spare time before classes start. Suggested topics include Git, Node.js, CSS, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and CoffeeScript.</p>

<p>I <a href="http://youtu.be/jM8KE_Fa6JI">studied Backbone.js</a> a bit more, I read about JavaScript <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/580165/JavaScript-Best-Practices">best</a> <a href="http://www.thinkful.com/learn/javascript-best-practices-1/">practices</a>, and I spent a lot of time doing more Code School tutorials. Some are better than others. I mostly looked at HTML/CSS stuff, which sounds easy, but I just wanted to make sure there weren’t too many gaps in my fundamental knowledge (<code>position</code> and <code>display</code> properties still slap me around sometimes).</p>

<p><strong>The <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/fundamentals-of-design">Code School tutorial on the Fundamentals of Design</a> was pretty awesome</strong> actually. It’s the only tutorial that doesn’t require coding, but it imparted quite a few cool nuggets of knowledge about how to choose fonts, colors, and layouts. The layouts part wasn’t as insightful (I wish they had you actually implement a grid with some coding), but learning about typeface categories (e.g., humanist vs. transitional vs. modern) and what defines a good color scheme (e.g., 60 degrees of hue separation) was sweeeet. Hopefully I’ll get around to blogging about the basics of fonts and colors one day. It’s just some very simple stuff that can help a lot.</p>

<p>Overall, I didn’t do as much studying on my own as I should have. I suck at independent study. Bahumbug.</p>

<h1 id="im-so-friggin-nervous">I’m so friggin’ nervous!</h1>
<p>Although the pre-course check-in meeting left me feeling optimistic about my future success at Hack Reactor, I no longer feel quite so confident.</p>

<p>This past weekend, I got access to my cohort’s Google Group. I bet that Hack Reactor nearly forgot to add me to the group. I browsed the group forum, and I saw posts dating back from July. There were some posts in August about meeting up to get to know one another before our Hack Reactor course starts. Doh! I missed those opportunities!</p>

<p>There was also a thread of self-introductions. Only a handful of people introduced themselves, but damn! They sound impressive. They make me worry about how I’ll compare. What’s funny is that a lot of them are non-Asians who have lived in China. They can speak Mandarin way better than I can (i.e., I only know a few basic words). Hopefully I don’t get a lot of flak. I already get enough grief from my mom.</p>

<h1 id="my-plans-for-blogging">My plans for blogging</h1>
<p>Considering that I will be busier than I have ever been in my entire life(?), I probably won’t have much time for blogging, but I am determined to do a fair amount of blogging anyway!</p>

<p>I still have plenty of <a href="/blog/categories/bootcamp-research/">coding bootcamp research</a> to blog about, but I will give my HackR Diary a higher priority. I’ve set a goal to blog about my experience at Hack Reactor at least once per week. Each diary entry will include a quick recap of topics taught by HackR staff, observational knowledge nuggets I picked up myself, and my personal evaluation of myself and the bootcamp.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wanted a way to count visitors for my blog. Easy enough, right? Just sign up for a free Google Analytics account, obtain a tracking ID from the account, and add the tracking ID to Octopress config file…right?</p>

<p>Wrong. Maybe I was doing something else incorrectly, but I didn’t get things working until I did <a href="http://stefanalfbo.github.io/blog/2013/04/17/octopress-google-analytics-github-pages/">what a guy named Stefan Alfbo wrote about</a>. I found his blog post via Google, which reminds me that my own blog’s Google-powered search doesn’t seem to work <strong>:(</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="problem-solved">Problem solved</h2>

<p>Here’s the trick for getting Google Analytics working on an Octopress blog hosted on Github: open up the <strong>source/_includes/google_analytics.html</strong> file and add…</p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">

<h2 id="questions-remain">Questions remain</h2>

<p>Alfbo recommends putting this new line of code in between the 2 existing <code>_gaq.push</code> statements. I’m not sure if the order of the <code>_gaq</code> array really matters, but I didn’t want to chance it, so I followed his recommendation. However, this left me wondering, “What is the <code>_gaq</code> array anyway? How is it used? And why does it need special attention to get it working with Github hosting?”</p>

<p>In <a href="/blog/2013/09/10/coding-bootcamp-research-admissions-processes-applications-and-interviews-part-1/">part 1</a>, I gave tips on tackling the admissions processes for coding bootcamps. In this article, I shall recap my personal experiences (all taking place in August 2013) with App Academy, Coding Dojo, Dev Bootcamp, General Assembly, Hack Reactor, and RocketU …in alphabetical order? Sure, why not.</p>

<p>I won’t be covering answers to questions I asked at these interviews. I will cover some coding challenges and questions interviewers asked me. I will redact names. Originally, I wanted to include names, but for the sake of writing more openly, I decided to do some Find and Replace. If you apply to the bootcamps mentioned below, you’ll probably end up discovering a few of the names I’ve redacted anyway.</p>

<p>In a future <a href="/blog/categories/bootcamp-research/">Coding Bootcamp Research</a> blog post, I will provide all the info I gleaned from my interviews.</p>

  <li>Another 45-minute online quiz in Ruby</li>

</ol>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>BUZZKILL ALERT: I put a lot of time/effort into studying for their pre-interview Ruby quiz only to find out I had to do a 2nd quiz to get an interview. At that point, I was already interviewing with the other bootcamps, and I wasn’t motivated to contine with my App Academy admissions process. I really believe that interviews help show me how awesome a given bootcamp is –so <strong>2 pre-interview quizzes is like 2 obstacles to accessing a sales pitch I actually WANT.</strong></p>

<h2 id="full-recap">Full Recap</h2>

<p>I don’t remember if the response was immediate or took a few days to come my way, but soon after I submitted my App Academy application, I got an email telling me that I had to complete a 45-minute Ruby quiz before my admissions process could continue.</p>

<p>The quiz came with instructions to help me study/prepare. It did not come with a deadline, and there was no countdown timer even though I was told I only had 45 minutes to finish. The quiz just involved implementing some functions. I completed the challenges in about 20-30 minutes. I then spend another 15 minutes refactoring the code. I’m not too familiar with Ruby, but I did learn a lot of fun things about the language that makes it possible to write incredibly concise code. <strong>It was a great quiz (what a weird thing to say).</strong></p>

<p>A day after I submitted my quiz, I got an email telling me to do yet another quiz. At this point, I was not happy. Clearly, App Academy wants to really weed people out of their admissions. I understand that, but I very badly wanted to start the interview process sooner than later. A second quiz meant I’d have to spend more time studying Ruby when I was already busy with applying to other bootcamps and preparing for their interviews.</p>

<p>Maybe I should’ve given them a chance, but I was already less interested in App Academy because they didn’t seem to stand out in any major way other than their deferred payment plan. So I ended up abandoning my App Academy application, and I never got an interview with them.</p>

<p>Originally, I was intrigued by App Academy because it has a reputation for being tougher, putting it at the same high-caliber level as Hack Reactor. However, Hack Reactor seemed to put a lot more effort into community outreach, Quora posting, and just putting out more good vibes to get me excited about their program. In other words, <strong>App Academy’s marketing was over-shadowed by Hack Reactor’s marketing.</strong> I know that probably sounds really lame, but it’s the truth for my personal experience. As for the other bootcamps, they intrigued me by differentiating themselves in other ways.</p>

<h2 id="tldr-1">TL;DR</h2>

<p>Dojo only put me through 1 non-technical interview. The interview gave me a positive impression of the bootcamp culture, but other factors (like a weird pre-interview video) left me raising an eyebrow.</p>

<h2 id="full-recap-1">Full Recap</h2>

<p>Before my interview with Coding Dojo, <strong>I was emailed a link to a private pre-interview video.</strong> I was excited about what it could possibly cover. I was disappointed to learn it was a FAQs video. I won’t reveal the link or password, but I will give a quick overview of the contents.</p>

<p>The video was a mediocre-quality recording of [CD person 1] talking to the camera. It was unedited, and just didn’t feel very professional. The whole time I watched him answer some FAQs, <strong>I kept wondering why the answers weren’t on the FAQ page of the Coding Dojo website.</strong> Why were these questions and answers password-protected?</p>

<p>Maybe it’s because [CD person 1] answered questions re: comparing Coding Dojo to its competitors by admitting that their hiring network was smaller than most. The only reassurance provided was along the lines of “don’t worry, we’re working on it.”</p>

<p>My first bootcamp interview was a phone call with [CD person 2], a Coding Dojo graduate-turned-teaching-assistant (aka Hacker-in-Residence or Developer-in-Residence). He was incredibly nice, and I dug his personality. He didn’t ask me any technical questions. He only asked me questions about myself to help set my expectations and gauge my motivation levels. He made me feel better about Coding Dojo, but I still figured the other bootcamps would probably do a better job of impressing me.</p>

<p>About 6 days after the interview, I was emailed an offer to enroll in Coding Dojo’s September cohort. After about a week, I declined their offer.</p>

<h1 id="dev-bootcamp----i-didnt-actually-apply">Dev Bootcamp – I didn’t actually apply</h1>

<p>I wanted to join a bootcamp ASAP. DBC’s website says they’re sold out for the next 6 months, so I didn’t bother applying to their program.</p>

<p>A few days ago, I met someone currently in Dev Bootcamp. She said that <strong>DBC is actually flexible in cohort placement.</strong> In fact, she was able to enter a sold out cohort.</p>

<h2 id="tldr-2">TL;DR</h2>

<p>I may have done a few things that screwed up my relationship with GA. Other than that, their admissions process was easy and fun.</p>

<h2 id="full-recap-2">Full Recap</h2>

<p>There’s some relevant backstory I need to tell you first. It all started BEFORE I cared about bootcamps. I enrolled in GA’s Front-End Web Development (FEWD) course. It’s 9 hours per class x 1 class per week x 10 weeks …for $3,000 (or maybe it was $3.5k; I don’t quite remember). I was really excited about the course, but I was worried it covered too many of the basics I already taught myself. I also worried that it wouldn’t really help me get a job due to lack of rigor.</p>

<p>Eventually, I became way more interested in bootcamps, which provide much more learning per dollar spent. Furthermore, the GA FEWD course was clearly aimed at weekend warriors. I’m unemployed, so I may as well invest in a more immersive experience.</p>

<p>Ok…enough excuses. The point is that I eventually canceled my enrollment a few days before the course started. This left a bad impression on GA. [GA person 1] was very patient with me, but I could tell he wasn’t happy with me. He agreed to begin my admissions process for GA’s bootcamp after a phone call (which turned out to be my first interview). The phone call was scheduled after I sent an email to GA asking why my bootcamp application hadn’t gotten a response. <em>Awkward.</em> [GA person 1] even told me he thinks I’d be better served by GA’s FEWD rather than GA’s WDI (Web Development Immersive, which is what they call their bootcamp). I didn’t express it, but I kind of took his comment as an insult. Please forgive my arrogance.</p>

<h3 id="back-to-the-actual-ga-bootcamp-admissions-process">Back to the actual GA bootcamp admissions process</h3>

<p>Via email, I was instructed to do a GA onine tutorial using their system called Dash. It was a pretty good-looking tutorial, but it covered really basic HTML/CSS + jQuery material. I was underwhelmed. I also had to create a simple About Me webpage (offline –no need to host it on the web). They made it clear that their expectations were low. They didn’t even expect me to use any jQuery even though their tutorial included it.</p>

<p>There’s a <a href="http://qr.ae/NvpkG">relevant Quora answer</a> that explains how <strong>GA’s admissions process is supposed to be less technical for the sake of preventing discrimination against applicants with less programming experience.</strong> This is similar to Coding Dojo’s view on applicants. This is the opposite of how App Academy and Hack Reactor approach applicants.</p>

<p>My second interview with GA was held at their offices in SF. I got there late. I was a sweaty mess because I took the BART to get into the city, but apparently GA’s offices are about 1 mile from the nearest BART station. I should’ve used the Caltrain. I’m a fool.</p>

<p>[GA person 1] greeted me as if I hadn’t ruined his life through my FEWD course cancellation, so things started off great. He sent me to an empty classroom where I could be interviewed by [GA person 2], a Developer-in-Residence. She asked me to talk about my About Me page. She asked me what challenges I faced, what resources I used for help, what I thought, etc.</p>

<p>Then she asked me general questions about my background, motivation, living arrangements + commute, etc. As I answered these typical questions, I was a bit befuddled by [GA person 2]. It wasn’t her line of questioning that made me think something was wrong, it was her communication style.</p>

<p>She didn’t give off that aura of excitement that other interviewers had. She also seemed taken aback by my conversational interview style as if she had expected me to take a more passive role. I think I talked too much? [insert joke about how I write blog posts that are too wordy]</p>

<p>I guess what I’m trying to say is that [GA person 2] made me think the interview was about me impressing GA rather than GA impressing me. As I’ve stated before, I believe all interviews are two-way streets.</p>

<p>Luckily, [GA person 3] took [GA person 2]’s place. Apparently she had been sent to interview me in his stead because he got caught up with work. This probably explains her demeanor, so I shouldn’t be so critical of her. She wasn’t prepared to conduct an interview.</p>

<p>[GA person 3] is also a Developer-in-Residence, but he carried himself with the confident vibes of a true pro. <strong>I liked this guy a lot. He made me feel excited about GA.</strong> I had to re-answer a lot of the same questions [GA person 2] asked me, but I got much more of a response out of [GA person 3] whereas [GA person 2] just sorted nodded dismissively as I spoke.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, our time was <strong>very</strong> limited (likely my fault for being late). There was barely any room for me to ask questions. [GA person 3] left and [GA person 1] re-entered. I asked [GA person 1] some questions from <a href="/blog/2013/09/10/coding-bootcamp-research-admissions-processes-applications-and-interviews-part-1/#interview-questions-for-you-to-ask">my giant list</a>, but at that point, I didn’t have my laptop in front of me, which sucked because I didn’t memorize many questions.</p>

<p>I left the building feeling very confident, but <strong>I never heard back from them.</strong> Not to sound too full of myself, but maybe they checked out my blog soon after I published <a href="/blog/2013/08/25/hack-reactor-is-my-future/">my announcement</a> about my enrollment at Hack Reactor.</p>

<h2 id="tldr-3">TL;DR</h2>

<p>Holy crap! The admissions process was so friggin’ tough!</p>

<h2 id="full-recap-3">Full Recap</h2>

<p>Before my first HackR interview, I was emailed a big list of things to study. The list included a lot of JavaScript’s built-in Array and String functions. Right off the bat, I felt a bit intimidated because although the material looked easy, the length of the pre-interview to-do list was exceptional.</p>

<p>I was interviewed in person by a Hacker-in-Residence named [HackR X] and a co-founder named [HackR staff]. Quick aside: HackR’s office space is really friggin’ warm so you should dress appropriately. I was sweating even before I got nervous.</p>

<p>[HackR X] asked me to do some live coding, which was so easy (basic looping, arrays, etc. in JS) that I got over-confident. I made some <em>really</em> careless mistakes (off-by-1 bug, overly-complicated algorithm, etc). Woops.</p>

<p>It’s all good though. [HackR staff] seemed intimidating at first by just focusing on his own laptop the whole time as if he was just there to casually judge me. However, [HackR staff] and [HackR X] eventually helped me edit my code.</p>

<p>Then, they asked me some questions. At the end of the interview, [HackR staff] did a quick recap, explaining that HackR has three objectives for first-round interviews:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Set my expectations - They wanted to make sure I knew that their program is no joke; it’s seriously intense</li>
  <li>Gauge my motivation/drive - They wanted to see how much self-teaching I’ve done</li>
  <li>Check my financial situation - They wanted to hear how I planned to pay the high tuition</li>
</ol>

<p>My first HackR interview was scheduled for 1 hour, but it lasted for at least 1.5 hours because I asked a crapload of questions. Before I interviewed with them, I was already extra excited about them because of some hype from <a href="http://kevinhamiltonsmith.com/hack-reactor-student-blogs/">student/alumni blogs</a> and <a href="http://www.quora.com/Hack-Reactor">their thoughtful responses to Quora questions</a>. So I put in extra effort into preparing my questions. [HackR staff] showed more interest in my candidacy-for-HackR-student when I started asking a lot of good questions that [HackR X] couldn’t answer.</p>

<p>Side note: [HackR staff] appeared surprised when I asked him about their refund policy. That’s ironic when you consider that <a href="http://hackreactor.com/developer-bootcamp-contracts">their own blog suggests you ask all bootcamps about refunds</a>.</p>

<p>After the first interview, I was told to complete a coding challenge at home before my second interview. I was full of confidence and empty of any commitments, so I scheduled my second interview to take place four days after my first interview. That didn’t leave me with much time, but [HackR staff] assured me that it would only take about 8 hours to complete.</p>

<h3 id="here-comes-the-pain">Here comes the pain</h3>

<p>It took me <em>at least</em> 8 hours. First, I was instructed to go through <a href="http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/">Code School’s tutorial on Google Chrome dev tools</a>. Then, things got quirky. It’s hard to explain, but the challenge included some unique presentation. You’ll have to explore it yourself. However, I’m not entirely praising it because the instructions felt somewhat vague even after reading the additional tips they provided. I remember reading a student blog that claimed <strong>HackR purposefully makes certain instructions vague or certain code buggy just to keep you on your toes.</strong> Too bad I forgot the name of the blog, so I can’t give you a link.</p>

<p>Anyway, I had to teach myself basic AJAX. I already taught myself basic jQuery, which was also a required technology for the challenge. Unfortunately, I didn’t have a very good understanding of AJAX. I got my code to work, but one particular feature functioned only after some guesswork. I didn’t truly know how that feature worked. Moreover, I could sense my app was only about 98% correct. <strong>My brain told me this was ok, but my heart told me to go cry like the weakling that I am.</strong></p>

<p>I should mention that Hack Reactor lets you ask for their help via email. So I did. Twice. The first time, I got a response within a few hours. The second time, I never got a response. So if you’re trying to get through the coding challenge, keep in mind that <strong>you cannot rely on their email help.</strong> Doh.</p>

<p>My second-round interview was a somewhat disjointed experience. At first, I was interviewed by Hacker-in-Residence [HackR Y]. Once again, I felt like I had over-stepped my bounds. When [HackR Y] asked me about my experience with the AJAX + jQuery challenge, I interpreted the moment as an opportunity to ask him to help me get my code 100% correct. We spent more than a few minutes on it before he decided it was time to move on. As it turned out, the interview was supposed to focus on new challenges, not the AJAX + jQuery challenge. That was an unpleasant surprise (considering the effort I spent overcoming its difficulties).</p>

<p>I began programming solutions to the new challenges, which involved pretty simple functions. However, throughout the interview, [HackR Y] randomly left to deal with a phone call. He described it as “the most important phone call of my life” so the man was not investing much attention into my interview. I didn’t hold it against him because he assured me my interview time would be extended as necessary, and I didn’t have any other plans that day.</p>

<p>Eventually, [HackR Z], another Hacker-in-Residence took over [HackR Y]’s interviewing duties. <strong>This is where I got my ass beat.</strong> [HackR Z] asked me to rewrite the functions I had just completed in a way that reused one after the other. Not only that, but the rewrite challenge also required the functions to accept functions as parameters. I believe all of this can be described as Functional Programming, a computer science concept I had never heard of before.</p>

<p>I managed to make a function that called another function while passing it a function. Hot damn. Then I was told to go another layer deeper. <strong>My brain replied, “DO NOT WANT.”</strong> I was abandoned by my own brain. I guess most people would call it “panic” but it just felt like I couldn’t think. It could almost be described as ignorant bliss if not for the soul-crushing self-disappointment that accompanied it.</p>

<p>[HackR Z] was cool about it. He guided me through a solution, then he brought me to a <del>beautiful backyard under false pretenses to put me out of my misery</del> conference room so we could talk more. I proceeded to ask him a bunch of questions, some of which I had already asked [HackR X] to answer (I wanted to get multiple perspectives for certain questions). <strong>I got the impression that [HackR Z] was not just cool, he was superbly chill.</strong></p>

<p>Plus, but he did something particularly considerate. The first thing he did upon closing the conference room door behind us was give me immediate feedback. He straight-up told me not to worry about my brain fart during the live coding session because he felt the whole ordeal qualified as a great interview.</p>

<p>I don’t casually throw around the word “epic” like many of my peers do, but [HackR Z] basically <strong>excorcised the demon of self-doubt from my mind.</strong> And it felt epic. The feeling of doubt felt epic, and the feeling of that toxicity evaporating felt even more epic. Epic, epic, <em>EPIC!</em></p>

  <li>Non-technical interview</li>
  <li>Semi-technical interview on HTML/CSS + programming concepts</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="tldr-4">TL;DR</h2>

<p>RocketU really felt extra eager to me. The new bootcamp in town really wanted to impress. The technical questions were trickier than they should’ve been due to some miscommunication.</p>

<h2 id="full-recap-4">Full Recap</h2>

<p>The first interview was a typical test of personality fit. I spoke with [RU person 1] over the phone for the first interview. It was a typical non-technical conversation about my background and expectations. She tried to talk up RocketU’s awesomeness by describing how amazing the instructors are, but for whatever reason, I started worrying about RocketU’s lack of cool factor. Other bootcamps feel like families or clubs. RocketU was missing that vibe (more on this a few paragraphs below).</p>

<p>The second interview had some very specific quiz-like questions, but no live coding. I loved the second interviewer. [RU person 2] is an instructor with a solid background in teaching technical material. He asked me questions about HTML/CSS. He then asked me how I would solve a very particular problem. After he gave me some hints, I realized that I completely misunderstood the problem when he first described it.</p>

<p>I actually ended up misunderstanding him TWICE, so it took me awhile to solve the problem, which is sad because the problem really wasn’t that difficult. It was just a re-phrased version of a classic algorithm problem/concept.</p>

<p>I wish [RU person 2] could’ve showed me around RocketSpace a bit more because I never even got to see the part of the office the RocketU students use. I only got to check out a portion of the main RocketSpace floor.</p>

<p>However, the real bummer is that the whole experience felt a bit more corporate (for lack of a better word) and a bit less start-uppy than the other bootcamps. This is pretty ironic considering that RocketU is part of a startup accelerator called RocketSpace.</p>

<p>There are a few reasons for the “corporate” feel: The office space felt less fun and energetic (it’s less intimate; it’s less open due to the presence of many small dividers), RocketU doesn’t have its own blog filled with stories to get you pumped up, and RocketU is too young to have a promo video showing off its cool students. Plus, RocketU is run by people with experience in corporate training. So like I said earlier, the vibe I got from RocketU was very different from the vibe I got from its competitors.</p>

<p>That said, I wouldn’t be surprised if my impressions are just plain wrong because RocketU doesn’t have as much outreach/marketing and my interviews weren’t particularly long.</p>

<h1 id="for-the-record">For the record</h1>

<p>I did not send followup emails or thank you emails after my interviews. I know you’re supposed to do that for job interviews, but I wasn’t sure what to do for bootcamp interviews. Looking back on it, I wish I had at least sent thank you emails even though everything worked out in the end.</p>

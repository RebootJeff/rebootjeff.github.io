  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/20150105/AngularRIP.png" alt="RIP? AngularJS" /></p>

<p>A few months ago, the JavaScript community had a rather negative <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-are-many-developers-upset-about-the-changes-in-Angular-2-0">reaction to an announcement about Angular v2.0</a>. <em>Quick aside: my boss lost faith in Google and jumped on the ReactJS bandwagon.</em> On a <a href="http://devchat.tv/adventures-in-angular/016-aia-ng-1-3-and-2-0-with-brad-green-igor-minar-and-mi-ko-hevery">recent episode</a> of the Adventures in Angular podcast, the Angular core dev team tried to clear the air regarding the general approach for Angular 2.0 and the differences between Angular 1.3 and 2.0. The podcast is surprisingly well-done. There are 9 people included (1 of them is THE <a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/angularjs-patterns-clean-code-released/">John Papa</a>; 4 of them are Angular team members) and yet they never accidentally interrupt one another or talk over one another.</p>

<p>I’ve listed some interesting bits I gleaned:</p>

<h3 id="some-misunderstandings">Some Misunderstandings</h3>

<ul>
  <li>It sounds like there might actually be a migration path for 1.3 to 2.0. There is no path yet because 2.0 isn’t close enough to completion to judge. The idea of <strong>“no migration path” was a misunderstanding</strong>.</li>
  <li>It is not necessary to use AtScript for Angular 2.0 (and it is not necessary to use Angular 2.0 for AtScript).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="some-rationale">Some Rationale</h3>

<ul>
  <li>They’re trying to re-make their routing module in a way that will be easier to use.</li>
  <li>Some things are disappearing for logical reasons:
    <ul>
      <li><code>$scope</code> is disappearing because they realized “controller as” syntax is best, so they want to revamp that system completely to avoid common <code>$scope</code> confusion.</li>
      <li>Code for directives will be totally different because <a href="https://d2eip9sf3oo6c2.cloudfront.net/pdf/egghead-io-directive-definition-object-cheat-sheet.pdf">Directive Definition Objects</a> as they currently stand are ugly and kind of convoluted (e.g., most directives don’t need a linking function, they just need a controller function –kind of like how most views/templates should use <code>controllerAs</code> instead of <code>$scope</code>).</li>
      <li>Angular’s module system will disappear because ECMAScript6 will have a native module system. By embracing the new ES6 system, it will make Angular 2.0 more compatible with future non-Angular modules (much like how all back-end JS embraces Node’s system).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>There are a few <strong>key motivations behind Angular 2.0’s design:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Mobile friendliness.</li>
      <li>Fixing mistakes they’ve made when creating Angular 1.x (e.g., getting rid of $scope).</li>
      <li>Simplicity and performance.</li>
      <li>Embracing future tech like ES6 and web components.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="some-points-of-emphasis">Some Points of Emphasis</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The new syntax looks crazy, but the Angular team claims that it will be much harder to convert a non-Angular 1.3 app to 2.0 than to convert Angular 1.3 to 2.0 –which sounds like a no-brainer, but as you can imagine, they’re really trying to emphasize that you should not abandon 1.3 just because 2.0 looks so different now.</li>
  <li>They emphasized how Angular 2.0 is still in a state of flux, so it’s too early to make business decisions based on it.</li>
  <li>The Angular team claims they are making changes for practical reasons, not purely academic reasons. In other words, they have examined how current Angular apps are made, deployed, etc. They don’t just think about what would be cool, they do think about what would be truly helpful/useful.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="my-takeaways">My Takeaways</h3>

<p>I know I sound like I’m defending the Angular team. To a certain extent, that’s true (I need to try some React.js one day to hopefully reduce my bias for Angular), but it really comes down to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They’re converting to ES6, which means it will probably be necessary to use a transpiler to convert core Angular 2.0 code to ES5 for older browsers.
    <ul>
      <li>Ideally, this won’t be a huge problem for evergreen (self-updating) browsers. Maybe they will support key ES6 features by the time Angular 2.0 becomes “mainstream” (in the same sense that Angular 1.3 is currently “mainstream”). Or maybe I’m dreaming :p.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>There were some huge misunderstandings when Angular 2.0 was announced (re: lack of migration path, role of AtScript, etc).</li>
  <li>It’s too early to really tell what Angular 2.0 will look like when it’s released.</li>
  <li>When Angular 2.0 does arrive, it may look syntactically different, but it will do many of the same, <em>Angulary</em> things (i.e., the Angular “flavor” of MVC, augmenting HTML markup, enabling powerful custom components, etc).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="newsflash-angular-1x-is-not-dead">Newsflash! Angular 1.x is NOT Dead!</h3>

<p><strong>Angular 1.4 is <a href="http://angularjs.blogspot.com/2014/12/planning-angular-14.html">coming in Spring 2015</a>.</strong></p>

<p>News of 1.4 landed <em>after</em> the podcast aired. It will bring the new router I mentioned earlier, a “first class” I18N system, slick-looking documentation (using <a href="https://material.angularjs.org/">Angular-Material</a>), and other goodies –including some breaking changes. :D</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/20141123/IMG_20141116_135049sp.jpg" alt="Teaching my JS Fundamentals workshop" /></p>

<p class="my-caption">Me teaching a JavaScript workshop for beginners</p>

<p class="last-updated">Last update on Nov 30, 2014 to add a great link to the &#8220;Compilations&#8221; section.</p>

<ol>
  <li>A couple of weeks ago, a friend asked me for advice on giving advice to beginners.</li>
  <li>One week ago, I taught a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/hackreactor/events/217841372/">class on JavaScript</a> for beginners (or <em>advanced</em> beginners –as I like to say).</li>
  <li>A few days ago, I recently found a <a href="https://www.quora.com/Should-I-purchase-a-Code-School-subscription-to-prepare-for-the-Hack-Reactor-interview">Quora question about getting better at JS</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>These three moments have had my brain wondering about how to point coding newbies in the right direction. After some Googling and recalling my own past, I’ve gathered some links that will hopefully help beginners and maybe even intermediate folks. However, I should warn you that I haven’t tried out all the various services for myself.</p>

<h2 id="the-basics">The Basics</h2>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/BL6Vs">This Imgur post</a> lists 6 sites that provide tutorials for getting started in coding. I’ve personally used Code School and Codecademy. They’re great, but after awhile, you’ll want to explore other options. They are not sufficient by themselves.</p>

<h2 id="compilations">Compilations</h2>

<p>These sites gather tutorials and various resources into one place. Most of these also give some guidance or roadmap to help beginners prioritize what to learn:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://programming-motherfucker.com/become.html">Programming, Motherf…</a>: Categorized links for various languages.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.bento.io/">Bento</a>: Links organized into manageable sections.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.whatsnext.info/#/javascript">What’s Next</a>: Links grouped by topic and difficulty.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/courses">The Odin Project</a>: Open-source web dev curriculum.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.jstherightway.org/">JavaScript The Right Way</a>: Links covering the entire JS ecosystem (basics, patterns, testing, frameworks, news/podcasts/feeds).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-fundamentals-of-js">The Fundamentals of JS</h2>

<p>If you’re specifically trying to learn the quirks of JavaScript, then <a href="http://www.meetup.com/hackreactor/events/217841372/">classes like the one I teach</a> are perfect for you. If you’re not near San Francisco, you can try <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/js-fundamentals-to-functional/">online classes</a> taught by the one who helped me become a teacher (<a href="https://twitter.com/biancagando">@BiancaGando</a>).</p>

<p>But these aren’t free. Ya know what is free? This great gathering of words describing vital JS concepts: <a href="http://javascriptissexy.com/16-javascript-concepts-you-must-know-well/">16 JavaScript Concepts JavaScript Professionals Must Know Well</a></p>

<h2 id="the-community">The Community</h2>

<p>San Francisco is my neck of the woods. If you’re lucky enough to be around here, then you should take advantage of the stellar community. There are lots of free meetups/events that can help you learn. If you’re not in the area, check Meetup.com for groups that provide similar events.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/tinderbox/events/212435202/">Tinderbox</a>: They often host “hack nights”, which might sound intimidating, but they’re very open-ended so you could show up and just ask for help learning a particular subject.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/SFRails/events/199733902/">SF Rails</a>: Much like Tinderbox, the SF Rails group hosts open-ended “protonight” events. The group might focus on Ruby on Rails, but you’re likely to find people who can help with any beginner or intermediate level coding topic.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re female, you might want to search for organizations that provide free support for women. Some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.womenwhocode.com/">Women Who Code</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.girldevelopit.com/">Girl Develop It</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://railsbridge.org/">Railsbridge</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/tevgende">Aysegul Office Hours</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Back in the day, I used <a href="http://curriculum.railsbridge.org/frontend/frontend">a free, online curriculum</a> created by Railsbridge to learn some web dev skills.</p>

<p>A Hack Reactor alum recently launched a free service called Hackvard. It helps people quickly find nearby programmers who want to meet up. After a few weeks (or days?), it was renamed to <a href="http://www.codaround.com/">Codaround</a>. One of the co-founders contacted me and mentioned that Codaround might be changed to focus on helping match mentors/teachers with students/beginners. I don’t know any details, but it’s worth keeping an eye on this.</p>

<h2 id="games">Games</h2>

<p>Want to play while you program? Here are some sites that turn learning to code into a game:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.checkio.org/">CheckIO</a>: When I <a href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2013/09/02/mini-review-of-checkio/">tried them out</a>, I wasn’t impressed by their attempt to cover coding challenges in a layer of gamification. A CheckIO employee reached out to me and told me things have changed a lot. I haven’t verified his claims, but their user base was pretty large last time I checked, and their blog is very active, so they’re alive and kicking.</li>
  <li><a href="http://codecombat.com/">Code Combat</a>: I played with this a couple months ago. It was fun, but a tad buggy. I like the idea of writing code to control your character.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.screeps.com/">Screeps</a>: This looks quite promising. You write code to control small armies.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-else">What else?</h2>

<p>Let me know in the comments (or via Twitter) if you know of any other solid resources that help people learn JavaScript and other programming skills.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p class="last-updated">Last updated: Sep 22nd, 2014 at 12:21PM PDT. I added <a href="#angularjs--csp">some info</a> about using CSP with AngularJS.</p>

<p>Last Thursday, I published <a href="/blog/2014/09/18/web-security-fundamentals-by-google-peeps/">a blog post</a> in which I summarized the main attack techniques (XSS, CSRF, and MITM) used by baddies to screw with the web. That post also covered two header-based solutions available to help you defend your site: CSP and HSTS. To supplement all that info, I am providing a bunch of articles, references, videos, and tools to help you learn more and take advantage of CSP and HSTS.</p>

<h1 id="content-security-policy-csp">Content Security Policy (CSP)</h1>

<h3 id="browser-support">Browser Support</h3>

<p>Cross-browser support for CSP is <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=contentsecuritypolicy">pretty good</a>. The latest versions of IE require the CSP header to use a special prefix (much like vendor prefixes for certain CSS features). Older crap like IE9 and below have no CSP support.</p>

<h3 id="angularjs--csp">AngularJS + CSP</h3>

<p>Sadly, CSP reduces Angular’s performance because the framework does some optimizations that run afowl of CSP. I imagine that the performance loss shouldn’t be a problem unless you have a ton of Angular expressions on the page at once (e.g., you use <code>ng-repeat</code> to generate hundreds of expressions).</p>

<p>Despite these concerns, CSP is highly recommended by the <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/misc/faq">AngularJS FAQ page</a>. For more info on how to use CSP with AngularJS, check out the <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngCsp">docs for the ngCSP directive</a>.</p>

Perhaps you should consider using <a href="https://github.com/krakenjs/lusca">Lusca</a>, a free module created by Paypal to quickly add and configure various security features such as CSP and HSTS. I haven’t personally tried it yet, but I plan to do so soon. Their README file makes Lusca look very easy for devs to use.</p>

<p>You can pick and choose which security features you want to enable. For example, if you’re already using <a href="http://angular-tips.com/blog/2014/05/json-web-tokens-introduction/">JSON Web Tokens</a>, then you may not want to use Lusca’s CSRF method while you take advantage of Lusca’s legacy browser XSS protection.</p>

<p>By the way, don’t get confused: Paypal uses their own open-source, Express-based framework called KrakenJS, but Lusca works with Kraken apps <em>and</em> Express apps.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Back in late May, I went to one of the most informative tech meetups ever. The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/sfhtml5/">SFHTML5 meetup group</a> organized an event at the Google SF office to cover web security. Google security researchers presented about 2.5 hours of lectures talking about common hacks/attacks, good defense, and the general state of web security.</p>

<p>You can check out the slides here: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/sfhtml5/events/179713932/#event_comment-362704742">click here if you dare.</a> You can watch the lectures here:</p>

<p />

<p>But if you don’t feel like sitting through 2.5 hours of lecture, allow me to summarize the best parts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Common hacks/exploits
    <ul>
      <li>XSS</li>
      <li>CSRF</li>
      <li>MITM</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Simple security best practices
    <ul>
      <li>Use frameworks/libraries to fight XSS for you</li>
      <li>Implement CSP to protect your front end</li>
      <li>Reinforce HTTPS with HSTS</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>I won’t go into detail about any particular topic.</strong> This blog post will simply get you started in understanding fundamental web security. I suggest you use Google to research more about hacks/attacks or wait for me to post another blog post that provides a collection of links to sweet videos, references, and articles that I found particularly helpful for learning more about all these topics.</p>

<h1 id="be-afraid">Be Afraid</h1>

<p>How are websites and web apps compromised? Why are sites often “hacked”? There are three main types of attacks that you should worry about: XSS, CSRF, and MITM.</p>

<h2 id="cross-site-scripting-xss">Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h2>

<p>When a punk manages to get your code to run their JavaScript, that’s XSS. A simple example is when an unprotected website just accepts text from the user and adds it to the site’s HTML code. If that text is actually JS, then the site ends up sending the browser user-generated code. Damn.</p>

<p>XSS is one of the most common problems plaguing web security today. This is pretty depressing because there are plenty of frameworks and libraries that help fight XSS, but so many site operators just don’t use them and some fools even try to write their own anti-XSS code.</p>

<h2 id="cross-site-request-forgery-xsrfcsrf">Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF/CSRF)</h2>

<p>Let’s say a user logs into your website or web app. They are now authenticated, right? Well it depends. It could be that the user’s <em>browser</em> is authenticated. An attacker could take advantage of this authentication and get the user’s browser to submit an HTTP request crafted with nefarious intentions. The request will be accepted because the browser has the right authentication cookie data, for example.</p>

<p>How is the evil HTTP request initiated? It could be through XSS, it could be through convincing a victim to visit a malicious site that sends HTTP requests, etc. Most examples mention authenticated cookies being used by attackers.</p>

<h2 id="man-in-the-middle-mitm">Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)</h2>

<p>There’s a reason why public internet is unsafe. When you’re on a shared network, other users on the same network can try to intercept your data. Not only can man-in-the-middle attacks read your data, they can also send you bad data/code. Some attackers merely intercept web pages you’re accessing, add more advertisements, and feed you the web page with extra ads. Other attackers might intercept your attempt to visit http://www.facebook.com, give you a fake Facebook login page, and convince you to submit your login info to them.</p>

<p>Obviously, protecting a network by requiring a password to connect can help. However, if you’re using public WiFi in a coffee shop where the password is given to anybody who asks for it, then you’re in trouble again. As I shall mention, HTTPS is crucial for fighting MITM pain.</p>

<h1 id="be-somewhat-less-afraid">Be Somewhat Less Afraid</h1>

<p>It’s great if you’re aware of threats. Now it’s time to learn the basics on how to combat the threats. At the meetup, the Google peeps focused on three types of solutions: frameworks/libraries, CSP, and HTTPS with HSTS. I will also mention a couple other technologies (BONUS) for your consideration.</p>

<h2 id="frameworkslibraries-features">Frameworks/Libraries Features</h2>

<p>One of the Google experts emphasized that XSS is a much bigger problem than it should be because there are so many frameworks and libraries that help fight XSS. He said that no one should be writing their own anti-XSS libraries. Instead, use one of the many open-source solutions. Also, it’s quite possible that you’re already using a framework that has anti-XSS features that just need to be activated or configured.</p>

<p>For example, in some templating libraries, a simple syntax change will enable anti-XSS escaping features. Other templating libraries automatically escape contents by default. Some frameworks like AngularJS do “round-trip escaping on all strings for you” to protect your app from XSS and other injection attacks.</p>

<h2 id="content-security-policy-csp">Content Security Policy (CSP)</h2>

<p>A server can instruct a browser to use a whitelist to decide which resources should be loaded and which should be blocked. This is done when a server adds a CSP to a response header.</p>

<p>For example, a CSP whitelist can tell a browser to trust script files from the server and Google CDNs, images from the server and Amazon CDNs, CSS files from the server, and web fonts from Google. Everything else will be blocked. In-line JavaScript will be blocked, in-line styles will be blocked, images hosted by 3rd parties will be blocked, Flash will be blocked, iframes will be blocked, etc.</p>

<p>Your CSP can be configured based on various types of resources. Check this <a href="http://content-security-policy.com/">CSP Cheatsheet</a> for the list of options. I recommend that you investigate server-side libraries, frameworks, or middleware that can help you implement CSP. When writing your CSP, you can try starting with the most restrictive whitelist and then see what needs to be unblocked.</p>

<h3 id="reporting-feature">Reporting Feature</h3>

<p>You can also set up a reporting system to find out what your CSP has managed to block (thereby identifying failed attacks).</p>

<p>A Googler suggested using the CSP reporting feature <em>without</em> an enforced whitelist to help you examine what browsers are actually digesting when they visit your site or app. For example, you could set up a CSP that has a whitelist and just asks browsers to report non-whitelisted sources without actually blocking them. This gives you the ability to <strong>tweak your whitelist based on production usage without changing production usage</strong>. After you’re done tweaking, change the CSP to force browsers to report <em>and</em> block uninvited resources and content.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption class="code-header" style="margin-bottom:-5px;"><span>Ultra-Strict Example CSP for Express server using Lusca middleware </span></figcaption>
 <div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
app.use(lusca.csp({
  <span class="key">policy</span>: {
    <span class="key"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">default-src</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>: <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">none</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>, <span class="comment">// Block EVERYTHING</span>
  },
  <span class="key">reportOnly</span>: <span class="predefined-constant">true</span>, <span class="comment">// Record what's being blocked</span>
  <span class="key">reportUri</span>: <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">/report-violation-endpoint</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>
}));
</pre></div>
</div>
 </figure></notextile></div>

<h2 id="https-and-http-strict-transport-security-hsts">HTTPS and HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)</h2>

<h3 id="https">HTTPS</h3>

<p>To protect data transfers from MITM attacks, many sites connect to visitors via HTTPS. HTTPS connections not only protect typical payloads like JSON, but also static files and cookies that would otherwise be vulnerable to CSRF attacks. The hard part about using HTTPS is making sure no part of the site ever falls back to unencrypted HTTP.</p>

<p>For example, let’s say you’re browsing a site that provides free icons and graphics. Are all files served over HTTPS? HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are no-brainers. What about images? Yeah that’s pretty standard too. But what about when you get an icon pack? You click a download link, and the browser starts downloading a zip file. Is that using the HTTPS protocol? It’s easy to <a href="http://httpshaming.tumblr.com/">make mistakes</a>.</p>

<h3 id="hsts">HSTS</h3>

<p>Furthermore, what if a user visits the site using HTTP first? It’s pretty common for people to type “somewebsite.com” in the URL bar and the browser will turn that into “http://somewebsite.com”. After they visit that URL, the site can redirect the visitor to “<strong>https</strong>://somewebsite.com”. But sadly, that initial connection via http wasn’t secure. It’s susceptible to a MITM attack.</p>

<p>With HTTP Strict Transport Security, the browser can automatically turn “somewebsite.com” into “<strong>https</strong>://somewebsite.com”. HSTS works by setting a header that tells the browser to enforce HTTPS for requests sent to the domain (“somewebsite.com”) for the next X number of seconds. Yes, you can set X to be a very large number such that HSTS is enforcing HTTPS for the next <em>year</em>, if you want to be cool like that.</p>

<h1 id="stay-tuned">Stay Tuned</h1>

<p>This blog post was getting pretty lengthy, so I decided to split it into two parts. In a follow-up blog post, I will provide a list of references, tutorials, and videos to help you research more about CSP, HSTS, and some complementary tools/libraries.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Software Engineers are hot shit right now. Recruiters pander to us by calling us rockstars, ninjas, and gurus. We are revered for our intellect, our problem solving skills, our powerful working memory, our familiarity with mysterious tech –but not for our communication skills. <strong>Why is this ok?</strong> If we’re expected to be smart, shouldn’t we be expected to grasp effective information exchange with <em>fellow humans</em>? Why is modern society still excusing coding “rockstars” from having to come equipped with high quality communication skills?</p>

<p><img src="/images/20140902/tin_can_walkies.jpg" alt="Tin Can Tech" /></p>

<p class="my-caption">Photo by <a href="http://gratisography.com/">Gratisography</a></p>

<p>How do I know that software engineers aren’t expected to have stellar communication abilities? While I don’t have hard data, I have met, worked with, or listened to a lot of engineers who have sub-par comm skills. And no one makes a big fuss of it, which makes me think no one has high standards for the skills I’m talking about.</p>

<p>On top of that, job interviews target coding skills, web tech trivia, and algorithms with minimal examination of proficiency in structuring arguments, explaining complex concepts, and intelligent discussion. There’s a <a href="http://qz.com/258066/this-is-why-you-dont-hire-good-developers/">pretty great article</a> by the CTO of npm that drills into this topic.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s all rooted by the tendency for engineering schools to suck at emphasizing communication in their curricula. My time in college certainly didn’t include any lessons on effective speaking. You often hear schools talk about the importance of group projects and working together, but they never explain what good teamwork looks like, what common pitfalls plague discussions/meeting, etc. Instead, they focus on teaching the hard sciences and math. Then class after class of students walk away with little or no appreciation for the subtleties and subjective nuances of conveying ideas to one another.</p>

<blockquote><p>I find it so funny that programmers laugh at all these subjective fields of endeavor when that is what they do.</p><footer><strong>David Heinemeier Hansson, Creator of Ruby on Rails,</strong> <cite><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LfmrkyP81M?t=18m30s">RailsConf 2014 Keynote: Writing Software</a></cite></footer></blockquote>

<p>The ability to “work well with others” is often mentioned as a requirement in job descriptions for programming positions, but how many interviewers and interviewees really know wtf that means? Does it mean employees are expected to avoid conflict like their lives depend on it? Is it benchmarked by low quantum of drama? Should it be deeply linked to “likeability”?</p>

<p>No. It’s about empathy, open-mindedness with regards to homo sapiens, and communication skills (among other things).</p>

<h3 id="who-died-and-made-you-king-of-communication-skills">Who died and made you king of communication skills?</h3>

<p>My point is that it’s time to stop letting engineers off the hook for lacking skills in listening, speaking, presenting, asking, writing, and critiquing. I’m no master in these subjects. My own skills are far from honed, but you don’t need to be a master to have some ideas on how to improve. Also, it can be fun to explore communication issues just like how it can be fun to solve mysteries in web app development. Besides, as engineers, we pride ourselves in being good at what we do, so shouldn’t we put some effort into gaining communication skills that make us even better at what we do?</p>

<p><strong>If you’re pondering my motivation for making such a big deal out of all this</strong>, then let me just say that impatience is a potent impetus. I started analyzing communication when I started noticing miscommunication and the toll it took on my patience. I’m not just talking about miscommunication during meetings at work. I’m also referring to poor presentations at meetups, chatting at networking events, conversing during job interviews, writing open-source documentation, writing test descriptions, etc.</p>

<p>When I don’t understand someone, I tend to wonder, “Wtf is this person even saying?” Then that little voice in my head chimes in, “Don’t be so harsh, Jeff. Maybe you’re just too dumb to understand.” After that, another inner commentator adds, “Fellas. Shut up. Let’s use our detail-oriented brain to brainstorm reasons why communication has fallen apart here.”</p>

<h1 id="lets-do-this">Let’s Do This</h1>

<p>We engineers are problem-solvers, right? Well here’s a problem: miscommunication. So let’s solve it. What’s the first step for solving stuff? Comprehend the problem space. Break it down. Then divide and conquer.</p>

<h2 id="breaking-it-down">Breaking it Down</h2>

<p>We’ve confirmed miscommunication. Now what are the root causes? There are too many possibilities to cover now, but here are a few:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Knowledge Imbalance:</strong> Person A knows something person B doesn’t know. The imbalance results in lack of context or incorrect assumptions.</li>
  <li><strong>Ambiguity:</strong> Is the person talking about this? Or is the speaker talking about that? What is this? What is that? Maybe we’re referring to different things. Perhaps less ambiguous nouns are needed.</li>
  <li><strong>Suboptimal Terminology:</strong> Lack of or misuse of terminology and jargon is pretty common in programming. For example, does everyone know what you mean when you say “collection”? Are you referring to an object literal that has a bunch of properties, an array with a bunch of elements, a MongoDB collection, or a more abstract thingamabob that “collects” stuff?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="divide-and-conquer">Divide and Conquer</h2>

<p><em>If X, then Y.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>If there is a knowledge imbalance, then identify who needs what info and let the glorious sharing of knowledge begin.</li>
  <li>If something is ambiguous, then ask clarifying questions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Et cetera. One at a time. We can get through this together! Let’s hold hands! –or not. Because even the nicest people fail to wash their hands frequently enough to earn hand-holding privileges. Don’t let your guard down.</p>

<h1 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h1>

<p>The next blog post in my <a href="/blog/categories/communication-for-engineers/">Communication for Engineers</a> series will focus on tips for presenting a tech talk. I’m oddly excited about it. I haven’t done any big tech talks, but I’ve attended plenty. There are some easy ways they could be better. There are common issues that are easy to solve. That said, I’m also working on a blog post covering web security fundamentals. In due time, I will write tips for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Presenting a tech talk</li>
  <li>Conversation (with emphasis on listening)</li>
  <li>Asking Questions</li>
</ul>

<p>If I’m not burnt out from writing about communication skills, I will also blog about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Giving &amp; Getting Feedback</li>
  <li>Writing (with emphasis on concision)</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>End-to-end testing can be pretty tricky. There are a lot of “gotchas” that prove how hard it can be for you to truly think from the perspective of a computer. Ideally, E2E testing is all about writing tests from the perspective of a user, but that’s not going to always provide smooth sailing when writing E2E spec files.</p>

<p>This blog post is going to focus on a gotcha that rears its ugly head when you have a fixed nav bar. Nowadays, it’s pretty common to see fixed nav bars. Let’s use Twitter as an example. Twitter doesn’t use Angular, so you wouldn’t want to test their site using Protractor, but what I’m about to talk about can also be applied to WebDriver (which can be used for non-AngularJS sites).</p>

<p><img src="/images/20140817/screenshot_twitter_fixed_nav.png" alt="Twitter nav bar blocking an avatar" /></p>

<h1 id="whats-the-big-deal">What’s the big deal?</h1>

<p>Here’s the problem: <strong>what if we want Protractor to click on the avatar under the fixed nav bar as seen in the screenshot above?</strong> Obviously, a human user would intuitively scroll to find an element before clicking on it. However, Protractor’s perspective is different.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption class="code-header" style="margin-bottom:-5px;"><span>Example A - E2E spec with potential problem </span></figcaption>
 <div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
describe(<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">&quot;Who to Follow&quot; widget</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>, <span class="keyword">function</span>() {
  it(<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">should include avatars that go to other Twitter profiles</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>, <span class="keyword">function</span>() {
    <span class="comment">// get first (index 0) avatar using class-based CSS selector</span>
    <span class="keyword">var</span> avatar = <span class="predefined">$$</span>(<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">.who-to-follow .avatar</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>).get(<span class="integer">0</span>);

    <span class="comment">// Will this click always work?</span>
    avatar.click();

    <span class="comment">// assertion of what to expect as a result of the click</span>
    expect(blahBlahBlah).toBe(yadaYada);
  });
});
</pre></div>
</div>
 </figure></notextile></div>

<p>When you use <code>.click()</code>, you might expect Protractor (or WebDriver, which serves as the underlying engine for Protractor) will try to scroll the web page until the target element is displayed before clicking. However, Protractor will only scroll until the target element is in the browser <em>viewport</em>.</p>

<p>Now imagine your test suite includes several tests (ooh la la!). In test #1, the actions of the test cause Protractor to scroll to the bottom of the page. In test #2, the test tries to perform the actions of <em>Example A</em>. Therefore, during test #2, Protractor tries to scroll back up the page until the target avatar is in the viewport, but this just brings the avatar directly under the fixed nav bar.</p>

<p>Then Protractor attempts a click by finding the center of the target. So even if a tiny portion of the avatar’s butt is displayed just below the bottom of the fixed nav bar, it won’t be clicked. Instead, Protractor will throw an error saying that the target could not be clicked. The error will also mention that the nav bar would receive the click event.</p>

<h1 id="well-that-sucks-now-what">Well that sucks. Now what?</h1>

<p>There are two main solutions to consider:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Un-fix the nav bar for your E2E tests. –Bleh!</li>
  <li>Add extra scrolling to your E2E tests. –Okay</li>
</ol>

<p>The first solution might not be a great idea because it’s a major alteration for the sake of testing. What if the fixed position of the nav bar causes other issues that your tests will reveal? I believe you want E2E tests to interact with a product that is very close to the product users will interact with. Changing the nav bar’s position just for testing goes against this philosophy. The main exception to this rule is animation: I believe it’s ok to disable animations for E2E testing just because it can take up a lot of time, slowing down your test/build process. Also, animations can just be very cumbersome for automated E2E systems like Protractor to deal with.</p>

<h2 id="solution-how-to-add-pre-click-scrolling">Solution: How to add pre-click scrolling</h2>

<p>The solution I use for dealing with fixed nav bars is to define and use a helper function that invokes <code>element.scrollIntoView(false)</code>. This method is a native DOM element method <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element.scrollIntoView">that you can read about on MDN</a>. You can’t simply invoke it on a Protractor ElementFinder object. You can’t call <code>elemFinder.scrollIntoView()</code> the same way you call <code>elemFinder.click()</code>.</p>

<p>Also, you may have noticed that <code>false</code> is passed into <code>scrollIntoView</code>. This tells the browser to scroll as far as it can in an attempt to align the bottom of the target element with the bottom of the scroll area. In other words, <strong>this solution only solves issues with fixed nav bars at the <em>top</em> of the viewport.</strong> Using <code>element.scrollIntoView(false)</code> will fail if your web app uses a fixed nav bar at the <em>bottom</em> of the viewport.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption class="code-header" style="margin-bottom:-5px;"><span>Example B - Solution: Helper function to align element with bottom of viewport </span></figcaption>

<p>There are 3 syntax options above because I just wanted to present a few different coding styles. As you can probably tell, <code>browser.executeScript()</code> accepts a couple of parameters. The first one is the script, the second one is the script’s parameter. The script can either be a function (technically speaking, it’s a function reference) or a string representation of the script’s body. Syntax Option #3 was inspired by a Stack Overflow answer for a very similar situation (it was for WebDriver, but it was easy to translate to Protractor).</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption class="code-header" style="margin-bottom:-5px;"><span>Example C - Using the Solution </span></figcaption>
 <div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
<span class="comment">// Somewhere inside test code...</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> helpers = require(<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">../path/to/helpers</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>);
helpers.scrollElemFinderIntoView(avatar);
avatar.click();
</pre></div>
</div>
 </figure></notextile></div>

<p>You may have noticed that the solution in <em>Example B</em> mentions promises, but the code in <em>Example C</em> does not use them. My understanding is that it’s not crucial to use every single promise that Protractor and WebDriverJS provide. For example, even though the <code>.click()</code> method returns a promise, you don’t see devs writing Protractor tests with <code>exampleButton.click().then(function() { ... });</code> all the time.</p>

<p>So why did I mention promises in <em>Example B</em>? Just to reinforce the fact that <code>browser.executeScript()</code> will return a promise. By storing the result in a variable called “promise”, it tells other devs what to expect. That said, I admit it may not be terribly valuable. Let me know your opinion on this or any other part of the solution presented here.</p>

<p>In <a href="/blog/2013/09/10/coding-bootcamp-research-admissions-processes-applications-and-interviews-part-1/">part 1</a>, I gave tips on tackling the admissions processes for coding bootcamps. In this article, I shall recap my personal experiences (all taking place in August 2013) with App Academy, Coding Dojo, Dev Bootcamp, General Assembly, Hack Reactor, and RocketU …in alphabetical order? Sure, why not.</p>

<p>I won’t be covering answers to questions I asked at these interviews. I will cover some coding challenges and questions interviewers asked me. I will redact names. Originally, I wanted to include names, but for the sake of writing more openly, I decided to do some Find and Replace. If you apply to the bootcamps mentioned below, you’ll probably end up discovering a few of the names I’ve redacted anyway.</p>

<p>In a future <a href="/blog/categories/bootcamp-research/">Coding Bootcamp Research</a> blog post, I will provide all the info I gleaned from my interviews.</p>

  <li>45-minute online quiz in Ruby</li>
  <li>Another 45-minute online quiz in Ruby</li>
  <li>???</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>BUZZKILL ALERT: I put a lot of time/effort into studying for their pre-interview Ruby quiz only to find out I had to do a 2nd quiz to get an interview. At that point, I was already interviewing with the other bootcamps, and I wasn’t motivated to contine with my App Academy admissions process. I really believe that interviews help show me how awesome a given bootcamp is –so <strong>2 pre-interview quizzes is like 2 obstacles to accessing a sales pitch I actually WANT.</strong></p>

<h2 id="full-recap">Full Recap</h2>

<p>I don’t remember if the response was immediate or took a few days to come my way, but soon after I submitted my App Academy application, I got an email telling me that I had to complete a 45-minute Ruby quiz before my admissions process could continue.</p>

<p>The quiz came with instructions to help me study/prepare. It did not come with a deadline, and there was no countdown timer even though I was told I only had 45 minutes to finish. The quiz just involved implementing some functions. I completed the challenges in about 20-30 minutes. I then spend another 15 minutes refactoring the code. I’m not too familiar with Ruby, but I did learn a lot of fun things about the language that makes it possible to write incredibly concise code. <strong>It was a great quiz (what a weird thing to say).</strong></p>

<p>A day after I submitted my quiz, I got an email telling me to do yet another quiz. At this point, I was not happy. Clearly, App Academy wants to really weed people out of their admissions. I understand that, but I very badly wanted to start the interview process sooner than later. A second quiz meant I’d have to spend more time studying Ruby when I was already busy with applying to other bootcamps and preparing for their interviews.</p>

<p>Maybe I should’ve given them a chance, but I was already less interested in App Academy because they didn’t seem to stand out in any major way other than their deferred payment plan. So I ended up abandoning my App Academy application, and I never got an interview with them.</p>

<p>Originally, I was intrigued by App Academy because it has a reputation for being tougher, putting it at the same high-caliber level as Hack Reactor. However, Hack Reactor seemed to put a lot more effort into community outreach, Quora posting, and just putting out more good vibes to get me excited about their program. In other words, <strong>App Academy’s marketing was over-shadowed by Hack Reactor’s marketing.</strong> I know that probably sounds really lame, but it’s the truth for my personal experience. As for the other bootcamps, they intrigued me by differentiating themselves in other ways.</p>

<h2 id="tldr-1">TL;DR</h2>

<p>Dojo only put me through 1 non-technical interview. The interview gave me a positive impression of the bootcamp culture, but other factors (like a weird pre-interview video) left me raising an eyebrow.</p>

<h2 id="full-recap-1">Full Recap</h2>

<p>Before my interview with Coding Dojo, <strong>I was emailed a link to a private pre-interview video.</strong> I was excited about what it could possibly cover. I was disappointed to learn it was a FAQs video. I won’t reveal the link or password, but I will give a quick overview of the contents.</p>

<p>The video was a mediocre-quality recording of [CD person 1] talking to the camera. It was unedited, and just didn’t feel very professional. The whole time I watched him answer some FAQs, <strong>I kept wondering why the answers weren’t on the FAQ page of the Coding Dojo website.</strong> Why were these questions and answers password-protected?</p>

<p>Maybe it’s because [CD person 1] answered questions re: comparing Coding Dojo to its competitors by admitting that their hiring network was smaller than most. The only reassurance provided was along the lines of “don’t worry, we’re working on it.”</p>

<p>My first bootcamp interview was a phone call with [CD person 2], a Coding Dojo graduate-turned-teaching-assistant (aka Hacker-in-Residence or Developer-in-Residence). He was incredibly nice, and I dug his personality. He didn’t ask me any technical questions. He only asked me questions about myself to help set my expectations and gauge my motivation levels. He made me feel better about Coding Dojo, but I still figured the other bootcamps would probably do a better job of impressing me.</p>

<p>About 6 days after the interview, I was emailed an offer to enroll in Coding Dojo’s September cohort. After about a week, I declined their offer.</p>

<h1 id="dev-bootcamp----i-didnt-actually-apply">Dev Bootcamp – I didn’t actually apply</h1>

<p>I wanted to join a bootcamp ASAP. DBC’s website says they’re sold out for the next 6 months, so I didn’t bother applying to their program.</p>

<p>A few days ago, I met someone currently in Dev Bootcamp. She said that <strong>DBC is actually flexible in cohort placement.</strong> In fact, she was able to enter a sold out cohort.</p>

<h2 id="tldr-2">TL;DR</h2>

<p>I may have done a few things that screwed up my relationship with GA. Other than that, their admissions process was easy and fun.</p>

<h2 id="full-recap-2">Full Recap</h2>

<p>There’s some relevant backstory I need to tell you first. It all started BEFORE I cared about bootcamps. I enrolled in GA’s Front-End Web Development (FEWD) course. It’s 9 hours per class x 1 class per week x 10 weeks …for $3,000 (or maybe it was $3.5k; I don’t quite remember). I was really excited about the course, but I was worried it covered too many of the basics I already taught myself. I also worried that it wouldn’t really help me get a job due to lack of rigor.</p>

<p>Eventually, I became way more interested in bootcamps, which provide much more learning per dollar spent. Furthermore, the GA FEWD course was clearly aimed at weekend warriors. I’m unemployed, so I may as well invest in a more immersive experience.</p>

<p>Ok…enough excuses. The point is that I eventually canceled my enrollment a few days before the course started. This left a bad impression on GA. [GA person 1] was very patient with me, but I could tell he wasn’t happy with me. He agreed to begin my admissions process for GA’s bootcamp after a phone call (which turned out to be my first interview). The phone call was scheduled after I sent an email to GA asking why my bootcamp application hadn’t gotten a response. <em>Awkward.</em> [GA person 1] even told me he thinks I’d be better served by GA’s FEWD rather than GA’s WDI (Web Development Immersive, which is what they call their bootcamp). I didn’t express it, but I kind of took his comment as an insult. Please forgive my arrogance.</p>

<h3 id="back-to-the-actual-ga-bootcamp-admissions-process">Back to the actual GA bootcamp admissions process</h3>

<p>Via email, I was instructed to do a GA onine tutorial using their system called Dash. It was a pretty good-looking tutorial, but it covered really basic HTML/CSS + jQuery material. I was underwhelmed. I also had to create a simple About Me webpage (offline –no need to host it on the web). They made it clear that their expectations were low. They didn’t even expect me to use any jQuery even though their tutorial included it.</p>

<p>There’s a <a href="http://qr.ae/NvpkG">relevant Quora answer</a> that explains how <strong>GA’s admissions process is supposed to be less technical for the sake of preventing discrimination against applicants with less programming experience.</strong> This is similar to Coding Dojo’s view on applicants. This is the opposite of how App Academy and Hack Reactor approach applicants.</p>

<p>My second interview with GA was held at their offices in SF. I got there late. I was a sweaty mess because I took the BART to get into the city, but apparently GA’s offices are about 1 mile from the nearest BART station. I should’ve used the Caltrain. I’m a fool.</p>

<p>[GA person 1] greeted me as if I hadn’t ruined his life through my FEWD course cancellation, so things started off great. He sent me to an empty classroom where I could be interviewed by [GA person 2], a Developer-in-Residence. She asked me to talk about my About Me page. She asked me what challenges I faced, what resources I used for help, what I thought, etc.</p>

<p>Then she asked me general questions about my background, motivation, living arrangements + commute, etc. As I answered these typical questions, I was a bit befuddled by [GA person 2]. It wasn’t her line of questioning that made me think something was wrong, it was her communication style.</p>

<p>She didn’t give off that aura of excitement that other interviewers had. She also seemed taken aback by my conversational interview style as if she had expected me to take a more passive role. I think I talked too much? [insert joke about how I write blog posts that are too wordy]</p>

<p>I guess what I’m trying to say is that [GA person 2] made me think the interview was about me impressing GA rather than GA impressing me. As I’ve stated before, I believe all interviews are two-way streets.</p>

<p>Luckily, [GA person 3] took [GA person 2]’s place. Apparently she had been sent to interview me in his stead because he got caught up with work. This probably explains her demeanor, so I shouldn’t be so critical of her. She wasn’t prepared to conduct an interview.</p>

<p>[GA person 3] is also a Developer-in-Residence, but he carried himself with the confident vibes of a true pro. <strong>I liked this guy a lot. He made me feel excited about GA.</strong> I had to re-answer a lot of the same questions [GA person 2] asked me, but I got much more of a response out of [GA person 3] whereas [GA person 2] just sorted nodded dismissively as I spoke.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, our time was <strong>very</strong> limited (likely my fault for being late). There was barely any room for me to ask questions. [GA person 3] left and [GA person 1] re-entered. I asked [GA person 1] some questions from <a href="/blog/2013/09/10/coding-bootcamp-research-admissions-processes-applications-and-interviews-part-1/#interview-questions-for-you-to-ask">my giant list</a>, but at that point, I didn’t have my laptop in front of me, which sucked because I didn’t memorize many questions.</p>

<p>I left the building feeling very confident, but <strong>I never heard back from them.</strong> Not to sound too full of myself, but maybe they checked out my blog soon after I published <a href="/blog/2013/08/25/hack-reactor-is-my-future/">my announcement</a> about my enrollment at Hack Reactor.</p>

  <li>Technical interview on basic JavaScript</li>
  <li>AJAX + jQuery challenge done at home</li>
  <li>Technical interview on Functional JavaScript (wtf!)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="tldr-3">TL;DR</h2>

<p>Holy crap! The admissions process was so friggin’ tough!</p>

<h2 id="full-recap-3">Full Recap</h2>

<p>Before my first HackR interview, I was emailed a big list of things to study. The list included a lot of JavaScript’s built-in Array and String functions. Right off the bat, I felt a bit intimidated because although the material looked easy, the length of the pre-interview to-do list was exceptional.</p>

<p>I was interviewed in person by a Hacker-in-Residence named [HackR X] and a co-founder named [HackR staff]. Quick aside: HackR’s office space is really friggin’ warm so you should dress appropriately. I was sweating even before I got nervous.</p>

<p>[HackR X] asked me to do some live coding, which was so easy (basic looping, arrays, etc. in JS) that I got over-confident. I made some <em>really</em> careless mistakes (off-by-1 bug, overly-complicated algorithm, etc). Woops.</p>

<p>It’s all good though. [HackR staff] seemed intimidating at first by just focusing on his own laptop the whole time as if he was just there to casually judge me. However, [HackR staff] and [HackR X] eventually helped me edit my code.</p>

<p>Then, they asked me some questions. At the end of the interview, [HackR staff] did a quick recap, explaining that HackR has three objectives for first-round interviews:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Set my expectations - They wanted to make sure I knew that their program is no joke; it’s seriously intense</li>
  <li>Gauge my motivation/drive - They wanted to see how much self-teaching I’ve done</li>
  <li>Check my financial situation - They wanted to hear how I planned to pay the high tuition</li>
</ol>

<p>My first HackR interview was scheduled for 1 hour, but it lasted for at least 1.5 hours because I asked a crapload of questions. Before I interviewed with them, I was already extra excited about them because of some hype from <a href="http://kevinhamiltonsmith.com/hack-reactor-student-blogs/">student/alumni blogs</a> and <a href="http://www.quora.com/Hack-Reactor">their thoughtful responses to Quora questions</a>. So I put in extra effort into preparing my questions. [HackR staff] showed more interest in my candidacy-for-HackR-student when I started asking a lot of good questions that [HackR X] couldn’t answer.</p>

<p>Side note: [HackR staff] appeared surprised when I asked him about their refund policy. That’s ironic when you consider that <a href="http://hackreactor.com/developer-bootcamp-contracts">their own blog suggests you ask all bootcamps about refunds</a>.</p>

<p>After the first interview, I was told to complete a coding challenge at home before my second interview. I was full of confidence and empty of any commitments, so I scheduled my second interview to take place four days after my first interview. That didn’t leave me with much time, but [HackR staff] assured me that it would only take about 8 hours to complete.</p>

<h3 id="here-comes-the-pain">Here comes the pain</h3>

<p>It took me <em>at least</em> 8 hours. First, I was instructed to go through <a href="http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/">Code School’s tutorial on Google Chrome dev tools</a>. Then, things got quirky. It’s hard to explain, but the challenge included some unique presentation. You’ll have to explore it yourself. However, I’m not entirely praising it because the instructions felt somewhat vague even after reading the additional tips they provided. I remember reading a student blog that claimed <strong>HackR purposefully makes certain instructions vague or certain code buggy just to keep you on your toes.</strong> Too bad I forgot the name of the blog, so I can’t give you a link.</p>

<p>Anyway, I had to teach myself basic AJAX. I already taught myself basic jQuery, which was also a required technology for the challenge. Unfortunately, I didn’t have a very good understanding of AJAX. I got my code to work, but one particular feature functioned only after some guesswork. I didn’t truly know how that feature worked. Moreover, I could sense my app was only about 98% correct. <strong>My brain told me this was ok, but my heart told me to go cry like the weakling that I am.</strong></p>

<p>I should mention that Hack Reactor lets you ask for their help via email. So I did. Twice. The first time, I got a response within a few hours. The second time, I never got a response. So if you’re trying to get through the coding challenge, keep in mind that <strong>you cannot rely on their email help.</strong> Doh.</p>

<p>My second-round interview was a somewhat disjointed experience. At first, I was interviewed by Hacker-in-Residence [HackR Y]. Once again, I felt like I had over-stepped my bounds. When [HackR Y] asked me about my experience with the AJAX + jQuery challenge, I interpreted the moment as an opportunity to ask him to help me get my code 100% correct. We spent more than a few minutes on it before he decided it was time to move on. As it turned out, the interview was supposed to focus on new challenges, not the AJAX + jQuery challenge. That was an unpleasant surprise (considering the effort I spent overcoming its difficulties).</p>

<p>I began programming solutions to the new challenges, which involved pretty simple functions. However, throughout the interview, [HackR Y] randomly left to deal with a phone call. He described it as “the most important phone call of my life” so the man was not investing much attention into my interview. I didn’t hold it against him because he assured me my interview time would be extended as necessary, and I didn’t have any other plans that day.</p>

<p>Eventually, [HackR Z], another Hacker-in-Residence took over [HackR Y]’s interviewing duties. <strong>This is where I got my ass beat.</strong> [HackR Z] asked me to rewrite the functions I had just completed in a way that reused one after the other. Not only that, but the rewrite challenge also required the functions to accept functions as parameters. I believe all of this can be described as Functional Programming, a computer science concept I had never heard of before.</p>

<p>I managed to make a function that called another function while passing it a function. Hot damn. Then I was told to go another layer deeper. <strong>My brain replied, “DO NOT WANT.”</strong> I was abandoned by my own brain. I guess most people would call it “panic” but it just felt like I couldn’t think. It could almost be described as ignorant bliss if not for the soul-crushing self-disappointment that accompanied it.</p>

<p>[HackR Z] was cool about it. He guided me through a solution, then he brought me to a <del>beautiful backyard under false pretenses to put me out of my misery</del> conference room so we could talk more. I proceeded to ask him a bunch of questions, some of which I had already asked [HackR X] to answer (I wanted to get multiple perspectives for certain questions). <strong>I got the impression that [HackR Z] was not just cool, he was superbly chill.</strong></p>

<p>Plus, but he did something particularly considerate. The first thing he did upon closing the conference room door behind us was give me immediate feedback. He straight-up told me not to worry about my brain fart during the live coding session because he felt the whole ordeal qualified as a great interview.</p>

<p>I don’t casually throw around the word “epic” like many of my peers do, but [HackR Z] basically <strong>excorcised the demon of self-doubt from my mind.</strong> And it felt epic. The feeling of doubt felt epic, and the feeling of that toxicity evaporating felt even more epic. Epic, epic, <em>EPIC!</em></p>

<h1 id="rocketu-is-new-and-eager">RocketU is new and eager</h1>

<h2 id="format-4">Format</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Non-technical interview</li>
  <li>Semi-technical interview on HTML/CSS + programming concepts</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="tldr-4">TL;DR</h2>

<p>RocketU really felt extra eager to me. The new bootcamp in town really wanted to impress. The technical questions were trickier than they should’ve been due to some miscommunication.</p>

<h2 id="full-recap-4">Full Recap</h2>

<p>The first interview was a typical test of personality fit. I spoke with [RU person 1] over the phone for the first interview. It was a typical non-technical conversation about my background and expectations. She tried to talk up RocketU’s awesomeness by describing how amazing the instructors are, but for whatever reason, I started worrying about RocketU’s lack of cool factor. Other bootcamps feel like families or clubs. RocketU was missing that vibe (more on this a few paragraphs below).</p>

<p>The second interview had some very specific quiz-like questions, but no live coding. I loved the second interviewer. [RU person 2] is an instructor with a solid background in teaching technical material. He asked me questions about HTML/CSS. He then asked me how I would solve a very particular problem. After he gave me some hints, I realized that I completely misunderstood the problem when he first described it.</p>

<p>I actually ended up misunderstanding him TWICE, so it took me awhile to solve the problem, which is sad because the problem really wasn’t that difficult. It was just a re-phrased version of a classic algorithm problem/concept.</p>

<p>I wish [RU person 2] could’ve showed me around RocketSpace a bit more because I never even got to see the part of the office the RocketU students use. I only got to check out a portion of the main RocketSpace floor.</p>

<p>However, the real bummer is that the whole experience felt a bit more corporate (for lack of a better word) and a bit less start-uppy than the other bootcamps. This is pretty ironic considering that RocketU is part of a startup accelerator called RocketSpace.</p>

<p>There are a few reasons for the “corporate” feel: The office space felt less fun and energetic (it’s less intimate; it’s less open due to the presence of many small dividers), RocketU doesn’t have its own blog filled with stories to get you pumped up, and RocketU is too young to have a promo video showing off its cool students. Plus, RocketU is run by people with experience in corporate training. So like I said earlier, the vibe I got from RocketU was very different from the vibe I got from its competitors.</p>

<p>That said, I wouldn’t be surprised if my impressions are just plain wrong because RocketU doesn’t have as much outreach/marketing and my interviews weren’t particularly long.</p>

<h1 id="for-the-record">For the record</h1>

<p>I did not send followup emails or thank you emails after my interviews. I know you’re supposed to do that for job interviews, but I wasn’t sure what to do for bootcamp interviews. Looking back on it, I wish I had at least sent thank you emails even though everything worked out in the end.</p>

<p class="my-caption">Image Credits: original boot by MilitarySpot.com; ridiculous editing by me</p>

<p>In this blog post, I’m going to cover some basic info and tips about applications and interviews for coding bootcamps. The bootcamps are selective programs. Read on if you’re curious about the application process and/or if you need some help preparing for interviews.</p>

<p>I can only provide my thoughts based on applying to Coding Dojo, Hack Reactor, RocketU, General Assemby, and App Academy. This blog post won’t be very bootcamp-specific, but in part 2 of 2, I will write detailed descriptions of my personal application and interview experiences.</p>

<h1 id="applications">Applications</h1>

<p>I filled out applications for RocketU and Coding Dojo first. Then I submitted applications for Hack Reactor, General Assembly, and App Academy. All applications consisted of web forms that were fairly straightforward, but some included interesting mini-essays. You can visit their respective websites and find the forms yourself, but I just want to mention that they aren’t too time-consuming.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I heard Dev Bootcamp’s application asks you to make a video of yourself so they can check out your personality. That might be a bit more time consuming. I didn’t bother applying to Dev Bootcamp because I wanted to enroll in a bootcamp program ASAP, but Dev Bootcamp’s application page shows their classes are sold out for the next 6 months!</p>

<h2 id="check-for-dates">Check for dates</h2>

<p>That reminds me: you should check to see what dates are available. Unfortunately, not all sites make it crystal clear. You might waste a lot of time reading a website only to find out later that their next open enrollment is too late for you.</p>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

<p>Note: These examples will probably be out-dated within a year or so. I imagine these companies will change their websites in due time.</p>

<p><a href="http://apply.devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp</a> - Their website doesn’t tell you they’re sold out for 6 months until you reach their application page, which you probably won’t do until you’ve read a lot of the other pages on their site.</p>

<p><a href="http://hackreactor.com/">Hack Reactor</a> - You have to scroll down about 33% of their single-page website before you find their start dates in a section entitled <em>The Program</em>. When I was just skimming, I missed these dates because my eyes were naturally drawn to the big jQuery, HTML5, etc. logos displayed just below the dates.</p>

<p><a href="http://codingdojo.co/">Coding Dojo</a> - They actually show their next start date right away. The first thing you read on their website is when, where, and how much does it cost. Good job, Dojo!</p>

<p><a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive/san-francisco">General Assembly</a> - A navigation bar at the top helps you skip to the <em>Schedule</em> list of available dates.</p>

<p><a href="http://rocket-space.com/rocketu/#bootcamp">RocketU</a> - The RocketU single-page website shows info about their non-bootcamp programs before getting to the bootcamp overview. They provide a navigation link to jump to the bootcamp info, and that’s when you’re greeted with next available start date and tuition cost. Not bad.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.appacademy.io/applications/new">App Academy</a> - Their navigation bar at the top of the page includes a link to dates. Their application allows you to appy to multiple dates. Nice touch! I don’t remember if any other applications have that ability.</p>

<h2 id="dont-fret-for-about-one-week">Don’t fret for about one week</h2>

<p>Also, you should relax after submitting an application because <strong>it took 2-7 days for the bootcamps to respond to my applications.</strong> I think some bootcamps provided automatic confirmation emails to let me know they got my application, but if I recall correctly, at least one bootcamp didn’t give me any sanity-fostering confirmation email.</p>

<p>If you don’t hear back from a bootcamp right away, keep in mind that they’re flooded with applications. I suggest waiting a week for them to respond to you before sending any followup emails.</p>

<h1 id="interviews">Interviews</h1>

<p>It’s important to consider that <strong>the interview process is as much an opportunity for them to wow you as it is a time for you to impress them.</strong> This is why I looked forward to each interview. I couldn’t wait to be wowed.</p>

<p>Before each interview, I reviewed my research on the particular bootcamp. I re-visited the bootcamp’s website and their blog to find nuggets of info worth asking them about. A lot of my questions probed for elaboration on something very specific to the bootcamp in question.</p>

<p>I had handful of standard questions about logistics, a few questions comparing them against their competitors, questions about curriculae, etc. You can find a list of questions at the end of this blog post. I didn’t ask all my prepared questions though. Sometimes, you need to evaluate how your interview conversations are flowing. I can’t say I flawlessly navigated these conversations, but I made conscious decisions to ask or not ask certain questions as the circumstances required.</p>

<h2 id="my-interviewing-advice">My interviewing advice</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Write down a ton of questions to ask for the final half/third of your interview. Asking a lot of questions makes you look AWESOME.
    <ul>
      <li>Ask questions that show you’re planning ahead (i.e., questions about logistics).</li>
      <li>Ask questions that show you’re serious (i.e., very specific/thoughtful questions).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Be prepared to answer basic questions that you already answered in your application forms. Examples:
    <ul>
      <li>Why do you want to do a bootcamp?</li>
      <li>How did you hear about us?</li>
      <li>Why do you want to learn to code?</li>
      <li>Can you handle the intensity of our program? Are you sure? Are you sure you’re sure?</li>
      <li>What prior programming experience do you have?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Do NOT panic during the technical portion of the interviews. If you don’t know something, just admit it. They don’t expect you to be an expert; they just want to see how much you know so far by asking progressively harder questions until they get to topics beyond your current experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>I panicked a bit in my Hack Reactor and RocketU interviews. In both cases, the interviewer was nice and helped me out. In both cases, I walked out with positive vibes.</p>

<h1 id="interview-questions-for-you-to-ask">Interview questions for YOU to ask</h1>

<p>You might think it’s hard to come up with interesting questions. I used to think that way, but then I stopped being cynical for 2 seconds so then my mind could do some brainstorming. Here are a few ideas for finding inspiration:</p>

<h2 id="question-topics">Question Topics</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Ask questions about something interesting mentioned on the bootcamp’s blog.</li>
  <li>Ask questions about specific topics covered by their curriculum.</li>
  <li>Find the interviewer’s LinkedIn profile or Twitter feed. You might find something cool to ask about.</li>
  <li>Ask for examples of something they brag about (e.g., if they brag about guest speakers or networking events ask more about those).</li>
  <li>Check out <a href="/blog/2013/09/04/coding-bootcamp-research-how-to-compare-bootcamps/">my list of factors</a>. Formulate questions about them.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="examples-1">Examples</h2>

<h3 id="logistics">Logistics</h3>

<ul>
  <li>What are the exact start and end* dates for the cohort that starts in (INSERT MONTH HERE)?
    <ul>
      <li>*Note: Some bootcamps don’t provide end dates on their websites.</li>
      <li>Are there any holidays or breaks?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How many students and teachers are there?</li>
  <li>Does the bootcamp use a rolling cohort system?</li>
  <li>What are a typical day’s hours?
    <ul>
      <li>What percentage of students stay extra late?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What are your payment plans/options?
    <ul>
      <li>Do you have a refund policy?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Are there any special requirements?
    <ul>
      <li>Do I need a Mac/Linux?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="qualifications">Qualifications</h3>
<ul>
  <li>What kind of industry experience do the faculty have?</li>

  <li>Do you conduct any alumni outreach?
    <ul>
      <li>What kind of support do you provide to alumni?</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/ga_logo_sp.jpg" alt="General Assembly logo" /></p>

<p>Last Thursday, <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a> hosted a presentation by <a href="http://bluelikeanorange.net">Jenny Tsai</a> (nice URL, by the way). Tsai is a pro UX designer, but her talk was meant for UX noobs. So instead of focusing on <em>how</em> to be a great UX designer, <strong>she focused on <em>what</em> is a UX designer.</strong> I’m not looking to become a UX designer, but the event was free, and I like hearing about the various roles involved in modern tech startups. Besides, I think all wannabe web developers such as myself wonder what differences separate UX design and web development.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I was a fool, so I didn’t bring a laptop or padfolio for taking notes, so I’m just going to relay the short bits I jotted down in my smartphone.</p>

<h1 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h1>
<p>Note: Tsai didn’t present this info in a DOs vs DON’Ts fashion. She didn’t do a “What’s the deal with wireframes” slide. I’m presenting the info my way, not her way.</p>

<h2 id="general">General</h2>
<p><strong>What is UX design?</strong> Designer is to developer as architect is to engineer.</p>

<p><strong>What do UX designers do on any given day?</strong> Draw wireframes and mockups, draft user personas, create task flows, and get user input.</p>

<p><strong>What’s the deal with “wireframes” and “pixel perfect mockups”?</strong> Wireframe is to mockup as sketch is to painting. It’s all about fidelity. Both are generally non-functional, but sometimes functional mockups are created just to demonstrate animations, screen changes, and general navigation. You want to use wireframes for quickly iterating on an idea. You should save mockups for later because they use a lot of time, which is equivalent to money. And I hear money is expensive these days.</p>

<p><strong>What are user personas?</strong> Looks more like a marketing thing to me, but it’s basically creating profiles of target demographics. For I’mPregnantNowWhat.com, a user persona is going to be a profile of a young woman whose tech savviness is at level X. She cares about A, B, and C. And so on. I zoned out for a bit here, so I could be wrong.</p>

<p><strong>What are task flows?</strong> Flow charts on how users interact with the website/app.</p>

<p><strong>Who do UX designers interact with on a daily basis?</strong> Product managers, marketing peeps, customer service folks, developers, and other designers. PMs have the vision, marketing cares about the branding, customer service gives you customer feedback, and developers are the engineering for your architecting.</p>

<p><strong>What is information architecture?</strong> Figuring out how relevant info is organized. For example, a shopping website could display products based on price, color, size, etc. For example, with Amazon.com, IA also involves deciding what product categories/options are displayed to the user so they can browse based on those categories/options. I imagine this is where the battle between overwhelming a user with too many choices and underwhelming the user with not enough info unfolds.</p>

<p><strong>What software is used by UX designers?</strong> Wireframing software (there are a ton to choose from), collections of pre-made buttons and other GUI elements (especially common for smartphone apps where you can drag and drop stuff like on-screen keyboards into the mockup), and Adobe Creative Suite for pixel perfect mockups and assets (such as logos or new buttons).</p>

<p><strong>What does it take to be a UX designer?</strong> Yes, you need some artistic skills. Tsai was an art student. However, you need a lot of logic, not just artistry. Logic helps you solve the problem of meeting user needs through UI design, interaction design, IA, etc.</p>

<h2 id="users">Users</h2>
<p>UX design juggles a lot of objectives, but in the end, it’s all about merging the product’s objectives with the user’s needs. The example Tsai kept using was Amazon. Amazon’s objective is to sell stuff. The user wants to buy stuff. To do that, a user needs to be able to easily browse, search, etc.</p>

<p>So how do you know what users need? You interview them. Regarding user feedback, Tsai mentioned the following:</p>
<table>
	<colgroup>
		<col span="1" style="width: 50%;" />
		<col span="1" style="width: 50%;" />
	</colgroup>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td style="vertical-align: top; padding: 5px;">DO tap into your colleague's friends and family. She emphasized the importance of that one degree of separation --it's a bias killer, apparently.</td>
			<td style="vertical-align: top; padding: 5px;">DON'T interview friends and family who might be biased or afraid to hurt your precious feelings.</td>
		</tr><tr>
			<td style="vertical-align: top; padding: 5px;">DO ask users what apps they currently love. Try to find out what their general preferences/habits are. Find out how they interact with existing products (and how much they like it). Users are less likely to guess or unintentionally lie during an interview if you ask them about their current behavior rather than hypothetical behavior.</td>
			<td style="vertical-align: top; padding: 5px;">DON'T ask users what they think about a hypothetical work flow, interaction, process, product change, etc. Users don't always understand the hypothetical impacts of hypothetical designs.</td>
		</tr><tr>
			<td style="vertical-align: top; padding: 5px;">DO find interviewees via Task Rabbit, Craigslist, or even Facebook.</td>
			<td style="vertical-align: top; padding: 5px;">DON'T be afraid to "cast a wide net" to get faster responses to your quest for feedback.</td>
	</tr></tbody></table>

<h1 id="what-i-thought">What I Thought</h1>
<p><strong>Tsai did a pretty great job. 9/10.</strong> Some of her presentation slides included small, hard-to-read text. It would’ve been fine for a smaller conference room, but I sat in the last row of chairs, and I couldn’t read a lot of the text. Other than that, she spoke well, the slides looked visually appealing, and she answered all questions easily.</p>

<p>I could do without the intro slide where she sighs over the fantastic view of the Bay Bridge she gets to enjoy on her daily walk to work. Then again, maybe I’m just cold-hearted; maybe other people loved that part of her talk.</p>

<p>I arrived 5 minutes late, but judging by the post-presentation Q&amp;A session, she neglected to describe her own career path at the beginning of her presentation. That’s a big oversight because this is an introductory talk! Of course audience members want to hear how you got your start! You can check out her LinkedIn by going to her website in case you’re wondering about her career history.</p>

<p>As for the content, after the one hour session, I definitely have a clearer picture of not just the roles of UX designers, but also the roles of those who interact with UX designers. <strong>The talk also gave noobs like me a better understanding of what it takes to make a web/mobile app.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The only real bummer was the acoustics.</strong> I’m going to whine a lot here, so skip to the <a href="#followup">followup</a> if you get bored. The General Assembly (GA) building is pretty nice. It has a few classrooms and conference rooms, but like all cool beans, GA uses a relatively open floor plan. Tsai’s presentation was held not in a classroom, but in an open area on the second floor. When I arrived, there were a handful of people working at nearby computers. They were chatting, as you’d expect, but that’s a distraction for audience members.</p>

<p>On top of that, the air conditioning system popped on during the last segment of the event, and it spooked Tsai. Everyone thought it was some annoying truck or something, but the sound didn’t go away. It really bothered Tsai. After she inquired, the GA staffer explained it was just the AC. Damn that was an annoying AC.</p>

<p>By the way, just like everyone else, I think exposed walls/ceilings, glass conference rooms, and open floor plans are slick as hell (especially compared to the drab corporate offices in DC). However, it’s <em>pretty obvious</em> that the recipe for office hawtness is also a recipe for poor acoustics. I’m surprised GA hosts presentations in the middle of an open floor of such a building. <strong>I give GA a score of 6/10.</strong> Yes, I’m sure my scores change the world.</p>

<p>Side note: When using folding chairs, is it possible to stagger the rows so then the columns don’t line up? This would help short folks like me see through the heads of taller people rather than staring at the back of the head of the tall guy sitting directly in front of me. I’m sure staggering rows would be less space-efficient, but if you’ve got a lot of rows, then the people in the back could sure use some help seeing the presenter and the projector screen.</p>

<h1 id="followup">Followup</h1>
<p>GA did a good job of following up with attendees. We were emailed a survey (in which I notified them of their crappy acoustics), a blurb about GA’s other UX classes, and two lists of resources, which you can see for yourself below.</p>

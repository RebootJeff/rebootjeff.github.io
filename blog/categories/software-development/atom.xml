    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="my-web-dev-setup">My Web Dev Setup</h1>

<p>It‚Äôs been nearly two years since I wrote about <a href="http://rebootjeff.github.io/blog/2014/05/15/my-sublime-text-2-setup-and-customization/">my preferences for Sublime Text 2</a>. In those two years, I‚Äôve accrued more tools, and I‚Äôve installed/configured a better web dev setup for myself. <strong><em>My current setup is <a href="https://github.com/RebootJeff/my-installfest">documented in a repo</a></em></strong>, which will be kept up to date so then any time I need to set up a new machine, I have a quick guide that I can reference.</p>

<p>There are a few aspects of my setup worth explaining‚Ä¶</p>

<h2 id="atom-vs-sublime-text">Atom vs Sublime Text</h2>

<p>I‚Äôve switched to Atom. There‚Äôs no doubt that Sublime Text is way faster. I still use it to read and edit extremely large files (e.g., large JSON). But Sublime Text always felt a bit clunky in its GUI. Most notably, the package manager for Sublime Text wasn‚Äôt very nice to use.</p>

<p>On Macs, Atom has a lot of great features for updating the software and packages. It has one-click installation of shell commands (e.g., <code>atom [filename]</code> to open a file in Atom via terminal).</p>

<p>On Linux, these features are missing, but I still use Atom on my Ubuntu machine because its GUI feels more modern than Sublime Text‚Äôs GUI. Also, Atom‚Äôs built-in Markdown and Git features are pretty sweet.</p>

<p>That said, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Microsoft‚Äôs Visual Code Studio</a> looks enticing. The battle of free code editors is really heating up! Visual Code Studio appears to be more powerful than Atom ‚Äì and I‚Äôve got to give it a try eventually ‚Äì but Atom‚Äôs community is at least 2x larger at the moment. The ecosystem of Atom packages is outstanding.</p>

<p>Some of my favorite Atom packages:
- <a href="https://atom.io/packages/pigments">pigments</a> to highlight colors (great for CSS/SCSS/LESS code that deal with colors)
- <a href="https://atom.io/packages/file-icons">file-icons</a> to show icons specific to different file types
- <a href="https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-emojis">autocomplete-emojis</a> because emojis can spice up any comment/documentation! üåü</p>

<p><img src="/images/20160425/atom_ss.png" alt="Atom screenshot" /></p>

<h2 id="browsers">Browsers</h2>

<h3 id="a-few-words-about-chrome">A few words about Chrome</h3>

<p>I still use Google Chrome as my main browser for development, and now I use a few Chrome extensions a whole lot: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo?hl=en-US">Advanced REST Client</a> for testing REST APIs and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc/related?hl=en">JSONView</a> for browsing JSON data.</p>

<p>For development, it can be helpful to disable the ‚Äúprefetch resources‚Äù advanced setting. If it‚Äôs enabled, the network panel of your Chrome DevTools might jump the gun, confusing you in the process.</p>

<h3 id="firefox-is-getting-better">Firefox is getting better</h3>

<p>That said, I‚Äôm enjoying <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/">Mozilla Firefox Developer Edition</a>. It‚Äôs got some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLo3w8EB99pqLRJBWRCoyGTIrkctoUgB9W">fancy dev tools</a> that I haven‚Äôt gotten a chance to use much, but the browser itself feels pretty speedy. Unlike normal Firefox, the dev edition has separate processes for each tab.</p>

<h4 id="mini-rant-modern-browser-wars">Mini-Rant: Modern Browser Wars</h4>

<p>Also, I like supporting Mozilla by using their browser. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YkTAu333xM">It‚Äôs good to have some competition in browsers</a>, and Mozilla has no conflict of interest with the web. They‚Äôre more likely to promote an open web as much as possible whereas Google and especially Apple have a conflict of supporting web versus supporting iOS/Android apps. <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/06/op-ed-safari-is-the-new-internet-explorer/">Some say Safari is neglected</a> by Apple because they care more about dedicating resources to iOS + the App Store.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs also a nice conspiracy theory suggesting that Apple would rather web apps not rise in popularity because that would detract from the App Store‚Äôs prominence. You could argue the same goes for Google and the Play store, but Google‚Äôs done some amazing work on ‚Äú<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps">Progressive Web Apps</a>‚Äù to make web tech (push notifications, offline support, etc) as powerful as native mobile apps.</p>

<h2 id="mac-tips--tricks">Mac Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/RebootJeff/my-installfest">My documentation repo</a> has more tips &amp; tricks, but I‚Äôll lay out a few here. They all happen to relate to making development on a Mac even better (I guess I‚Äôve been using my Mac way more than my Ubuntu machine lately).</p>

<h4 id="window-management">Window Management</h4>
<p>The latest Mac OSX has a built-in window layout feature, but it sucks. I continue to use <a href="http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/">SizeUp</a>. It‚Äôs free and more powerful/flexible.</p>

<h4 id="installing-software-on-macs">Installing software on Macs</h4>
<p>I try to install as much as possible via <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>. It makes updating installed software a bit easier, and it can help you avoid common pitfalls (e.g., installing Node.js via Homebrew avoids permissions issues with <code>npm install -g</code> that you‚Äôd normally have to fix yourself).</p>

<h4 id="horrible-smart-quotes">Horrible ‚ÄúSmart Quotes‚Äù</h4>
<p>Do yourself a favor and go into the keyboard settings to disable Smart Quotes. Otherwise, they could eventually find their way into your code and screw you up in the most insidious way (it could take awhile for you to realize you‚Äôve accidentally typed/copy/pasted some Smart Quotes into your code).</p>

    <link href="http://RebootJeff.github.io/blog/2014/05/15/my-sublime-text-2-setup-and-customization/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-15T20:32:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://RebootJeff.github.io/blog/2014/05/15/my-sublime-text-2-setup-and-customization</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Updated on August 8, 2014.</em></p>

<p>I use Sublime Text 2 as my text editor for coding. I don‚Äôt use a fancy IDE like WebStorm, but I do plan on trying out WebStorm more at work. Actually, I should probably upgrade to ST3, but for now, I‚Äôm happy with ST2.</p>

<h1 id="config">Config</h1>

<p>However, ST2‚Äôs light weight comes at a cost: you probably need to configure some stuff before you‚Äôre really ready to roll. Here‚Äôs what I do when I first install ST2 on a machine.</p>

<h2 id="key-bindings">Key Bindings</h2>

<p>First, I change the keyboard shortcuts for cycling through open tabs. The default behavior is based on your usage history (most recently viewed tabs), but I prefer just cycling from left to right. There‚Äôs actually another key binding that can cycle tabs from left to right, but I prefer using <code>Ctrl+Tab</code>.Therefore, I edited my key bindings like so‚Ä¶</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption class='code-header' style='margin-bottom:-5px;'><span>Preferences &gt; Key Bindings ‚Äì User </span></figcaption>
 <div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
{ <span class="error">‚Äú</span><span class="error">k</span><span class="error">e</span><span class="error">y</span><span class="error">s</span><span class="error">‚Äù</span>: [<span class="error">‚Äú</span><span class="error">c</span><span class="error">t</span><span class="error">r</span><span class="error">l</span><span class="error">+</span><span class="error">t</span><span class="error">a</span><span class="error">b</span><span class="error">‚Äù</span>], <span class="error">‚Äú</span><span class="error">c</span><span class="error">o</span><span class="error">m</span><span class="error">m</span><span class="error">a</span><span class="error">n</span><span class="error">d</span><span class="error">‚Äù</span>: <span class="error">‚Äú</span><span class="error">n</span><span class="error">e</span><span class="error">x</span><span class="error">t</span><span class="error">_</span><span class="error">v</span><span class="error">i</span><span class="error">e</span><span class="error">w</span><span class="error">‚Äù</span> },

</pre></div>

 </figure></notextile></div></p>

<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>

<p>Next up, I make sure my whitespace is configured to my liking. I think most coders who lift hefty amounts of JavaScript go with indentation 2 spaces at a time, so that‚Äôs what I do. I prefer it because it takes up less space than a typical 4-space tab, which is critical when viewing code in split-screen mode. I also like having the option to manually change indentation with spaces if necessary for alignment purposes. Mixing spaces and tabs gets messy.</p>

<p>I also configure Sublime Text to automatically add a new line at the end of every file whenever I save. It won‚Äôt add a new line if one already exists at EOF. I personally never suffer from lack of new line at EOF, but <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/729692/why-should-files-end-with-a-newline">some UNIX tools won‚Äôt work without them</a>, and I know lots of hardcore coders out there like using such tools. I don‚Äôt want to screw them over. With that said, allow me to present my ST2 settings‚Ä¶</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption class='code-header' style='margin-bottom:-5px;'><span>Preferences &gt; Settings ‚Äì User </span></figcaption>

<h1 id="theme-ui-skin">Theme (UI Skin)</h1>

<p>I use the Nexus theme, which you can find here: <a href="https://github.com/EleazarCrusader/nexus-theme">https://github.com/EleazarCrusader/nexus-theme</a>. The readme file explains a bunch of different installation options, but I recommend installing via Package Manager. The readme also tells you how to activate the theme after installation.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EleazarCrusader/nexus-theme/master/nexus-theme.png" alt="official Nexus theme screenshot" /></p>

<p class="my-caption">The orange and blue decorations on the tabs tell you if the file has been change since last save.</p>

<h1 id="packages">Packages</h1>

<p>Sublime Text doesn‚Äôt come with many bells and whistles. Instead you add them as packages. First, you must install the package manager by following <a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/installation#st2">these instructions</a>. After that, get ready to discover a giant pool of all the bells and whistles you could possibly want. If you need to adjust the settings for any of these packages, you can usually find good documentation from the readme files of their respective GitHub repos.</p>

<p>After you install Package Manager, you can access it by hitting <code>Ctrl+Shift+P</code> (or perhaps <code>Cmd+Shift+P</code> for Macs?) and then typing ‚Äúpackage control‚Äù into the search box. The typeahead will reveal your various options, but you mostly be using ‚ÄúPackage Control: Install Package‚Äù. There will be some load time necessary to provide you a list of available packages, but after it‚Äôs done, you can search for packages by name. Installation will similarly require some load time. Check the bottom-left of the ST2 window to see relevant status messages.</p>

<p>Here are the packages I installed:</p>

<h3 id="alignment">Alignment</h3>
<p>Prettify your code by aligning multiple lines of variable definitions and hash objects. For example‚Ä¶</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption class='code-header' style='margin-bottom:-5px;'><span>Before and After using the Alignment package </span></figcaption>
 <div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
<span class="comment">// this stuff‚Ä¶</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> x = <span class="integer">123</span>;
<span class="keyword">var</span> foo = <span class="error">‚Äò</span>bar<span class="error">‚Äô</span>;
<span class="keyword">var</span> exampleObj = {
  <span class="key">my</span>: x,
  <span class="key">name</span>: <span class="integer">99</span>,
  <span class="key">is</span>: <span class="error">‚Äò</span>Jeff<span class="error">‚Äô</span>
};&lt;<span class="regexp"><span class="delimiter">/</span><span class="content">p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;</span><span class="delimiter">/</span></span>/ would turn into <span class="local-variable">this</span> stuff<span class="error">‚Ä¶</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> x          = <span class="integer">123</span>;
<span class="keyword">var</span> foo        = <span class="error">‚Äò</span>bar<span class="error">‚Äô</span>;
<span class="keyword">var</span> exampleObj = {
  <span class="key">my</span>  : x,
  <span class="key">name</span>: <span class="integer">99</span>,
  <span class="key">is</span>  : <span class="error">‚Äò</span>Jeff<span class="error">‚Äô</span>
};
</pre></div>
</div>
 </figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>This may look stupid to you, but I don‚Äôt use it all the time. The main place I like to use it is with multiple <code>var example = require('npm package name here');</code> statements at the top of a JS file. By the way, I had to edit the package settings to get alignment for object literals. I added the <code>":"</code> seen below‚Ä¶</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption class='code-header' style='margin-bottom:-5px;'><span>Preferences &gt; Package Settings &gt; Alignment &gt; Settings ‚Äì User </span></figcaption>

}
</pre></div>
</div>
 </figure></notextile></div></p>

<h3 id="gitgutter">GitGutter</h3>
<p>Add indicators in your gutter so then you can see which lines of code have been changed since the last git commit. See the left edge of this screenshot:
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/ur6FY.png" alt="GitGutter in action" /></p>

<h3 id="sublimelinter">SublimeLinter</h3>
<p>I prefer live linting over build-time linting. SublimeLinter supports a ton of languages, and I have it set to simply bring up an indicator in the gutter and some underscores to point to any issues it finds. It‚Äôs not too obtrusive.</p>

<h3 id="trailingspaces">TrailingSpaces</h3>
<p>Extraneous whitespace is bad. Trailing whitespace is worse. I use this package to highlight any trailing whitespace in bright pink. I bet I could set my linter to do this, but oh well.</p>

<h3 id="markdownediting">MarkdownEditing</h3>
<p>Who doesn‚Äôt love Markdown? It makes GitHub README files and wiki pages look great. It makes dev blogs look great. It makes writing dev-related text easy. Sometimes, I write rough drafts of blog posts within Google Docs or <a href="http://dillinger.io/">Dillinger</a>, which is a sweet online Markdown editor. In the end, I always complete my blog posts by writing Markdown within Sublime Text.</p>

<p>I recently found a sweet ST package to help edit Markdown files: MarkdownEditing. It completely transforms the look and syntax highlighting of your Markdown. Sadly, I use CodeRay for codeblocks rather than standard Markdown markup. So MarkdownEditing can‚Äôt beautify my codeblocks within Sublime Text, but <code>inline code snippets like this one</code> are highlighted in a very helpful way. You can see all the ways that the package alters your Markdown <a href="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/35a66d68a55666133ba7911fb0ea61277740680f/68747470733a2f2f7261772e6769746875622e636f6d2f5375626c696d65546578742d4d61726b646f776e2f4d61726b646f776e45646974696e672f6d61737465722f73637265656e73686f74732f6c696768742e706e67">here</a>. Keep in mind that there are a couple other themes available specifically for MarkdownEditing. I use the dark theme of course.</p>

<h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>

<p>You might also find it handy to install packages for specific languages. For example, I dabble with CSS pre-processors and templating languages. I‚Äôm currently checking out LESS for CSS and Jade for HTML, so I‚Äôve installed syntax highlighters for them. The package names are simply ‚ÄúLESS‚Äù and ‚ÄúJade‚Äù.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My previous blog post was nearly 3 weeks ago. Why? What‚Äôs stopped me from posting more stories of life at Hack Reactor? For the past several days, I have been working on an individual project. I was very confident going into it, and I should eventually blog specifically about the initial stages, but as it turned out ‚Ä¶there is a crap-ton of stuff to juggle when developing a web app. There are so many things that can go wrong in your workflow ‚Äìnot just in your code.</p>

<h1 id="things-that-kept-me-busy">Things That Kept me Busy</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Defaut installation of node/npm on Ubuntu led to file permissions issues. Oh shit.</li>
  <li>Figuring out Yeoman: Before <code>npm install -g yo</code>: I wonder what will happen. After <code>yo generator-angularexpress</code>: What is all this stuff?! Oh nice.</li>
  <li>Figuring out Grunt: How can I get it to work with Stylus? Oh nice.</li>
  <li>Easy, but time-consuming (to make sure you don‚Äôt break something that used to work)
    <ul>
      <li>Organizing files/folders in a professional way (inter-file <code>require</code> statements can break)</li>
      <li>Using environment variables (typos can be devastating)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Facebook Authorization
    <ul>
      <li>Making 2 FB apps (one for dev environment; one for production environment)</li>
      <li>Figuring out the proper callback URL</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Databases
    <ul>
      <li>Juggling MySQL in development environment, then switching to PostgreSQL in production.</li>
      <li>Why is the production database getting flooded? Oh there‚Äôs a random configuration setting I missed in Sequelize.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Random Heroku hiccups (at one point, a node module provider went down, causing Heroku‚Äôs <code>npm install</code> to die).</li>
</ul>

<p>These are just a few of the little obstacles that add up. You don‚Äôt see them coming. They take quite a bit of time to hunt down.</p>

<h1 id="nerdy-chuck-norris-jokes">Nerdy Chuck Norris Jokes</h1>

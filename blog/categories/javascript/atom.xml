<p class="my-caption">Me teaching a JavaScript workshop for beginners</p>

<ol>
  <li>A couple of weeks ago, a friend asked me for advice on giving advice to beginners.</li>
  <li>One week ago, I taught a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/hackreactor/events/217841372/">class on JavaScript</a> for beginners (or <em>advanced</em> beginners –as I like to say).</li>
  <li>A few days ago, I recently found a <a href="https://www.quora.com/Should-I-purchase-a-Code-School-subscription-to-prepare-for-the-Hack-Reactor-interview">Quora question about getting better at JS</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>These three moments have had my brain wondering about how to point coding newbies in the right direction. After some Googling and recalling my own past, I’ve gathered some links that will hopefully help beginners and maybe even intermediate folks. However, I should warn you that I haven’t tried out all the various services for myself.</p>

<h2 id="the-basics">The Basics</h2>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/BL6Vs">This Imgur post</a> lists 6 sites that provide tutorials for getting started in coding. I’ve personally used Code School and Codecademy. They’re great, but after awhile, you’ll want to explore other options. They are not sufficient by themselves.</p>

<h2 id="compilations">Compilations</h2>

<p>These sites gather tutorials and various resources into one place. Most of these also give some guidance or roadmap to help beginners prioritize what to learn:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://programming-motherfucker.com/become.html">Programming, Motherf…</a>: Categorized links</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.bento.io/">Bento</a>: Curated links packaged into manageable sections.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.whatsnext.info/#/javascript">What’s Next</a>: Curated links grouped by topic and difficulty.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/courses">The Odin Project</a>: Open-source curriculum.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-fundamentals-of-js">The Fundamentals of JS</h2>

<p>If you’re specifically trying to learn the quirks of JavaScript, then <a href="http://www.meetup.com/hackreactor/events/217841372/">classes like the one I teach</a> are perfect for you. If you’re not near San Francisco, you can try <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/js-fundamentals-to-functional/">online classes</a> taught by the one who helped me become a teacher (<a href="https://twitter.com/biancagando">@BiancaGando</a>).</p>

<p>But these aren’t free. Ya know what is free? This great gather of words about vital JS concepts: <a href="http://javascriptissexy.com/16-javascript-concepts-you-must-know-well/">16 JavaScript Concepts JavaScript Professionals Must Know Well</a></p>

<h2 id="the-community">The Community</h2>

<p>San Francisco is my neck of the woods. If you’re lucky enough to be around here, then you should take advantage of the stellar community. There are lots of free meetups/events that can help you learn. If you’re not in the area, check Meetup.com for groups that provide similar events.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/tinderbox/events/212435202/">Tinderbox</a>: They often host “hack nights”, which might sound intimidating, but they’re very open-ended so you could show up and just ask for help learning a particular subject.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/SFRails/events/199733902/">SF Rails</a>: Much like Tinderbox, the SF Rails group hosts open-ended “protonight” events. The group might focus on Ruby on Rails, but you’re likely to find people who can help with any beginner or intermediate level coding topic.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re female, you might want to search for organizations that provide free support for women. Some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.womenwhocode.com/">Women Who Code</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.girldevelopit.com/">Girl Develop It</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://railsbridge.org/">Railsbridge</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/tevgende">Aysegul Office Hours</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Back in the day, I used <a href="http://curriculum.railsbridge.org/frontend/frontend">a free, online curriculum</a> created by Railsbridge to learn some web dev skills.</p>

<p>A Hack Reactor alum recently launched a free service called Hackvard. It helps people quickly find nearby programmers who want to meet up. After a few weeks (or days?), it was renamed to <a href="http://www.codaround.com/">Codaround</a>. One of the co-founders contacted me and mentioned that Codaround might be changed to focus on helping match mentors/teachers with students/beginners. I don’t know any details, but it’s worth keeping an eye on this.</p>

<h2 id="games">Games</h2>

<p>Want to play while you program? Here are some sites that turn learning to code into a game:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.checkio.org/">CheckIO</a>: When I <a href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2013/09/02/mini-review-of-checkio/">tried them out</a>, I wasn’t impressed by their attempt to cover coding challenges in a layer of gamification. A CheckIO employee reached out to me and told me things have changed a lot. I haven’t verified his claims, but their user base was pretty large last time I checked, and their blog is very active, so they’re alive and kicking.</li>
  <li><a href="http://codecombat.com/">Code Combat</a>: I played with this a couple months ago. It was fun, but a tad buggy. I like the idea of writing code to control your character.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.screeps.com/">Screeps</a>: This looks quite promising. You write code to control small armies.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-else">What else?</h2>

<p>Let me know in the comments (or via Twitter) if you know of any other solid resources that help people learn JavaScript and other programming skills.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p class="last-updated">Last updated: Sep 22nd, 2014 at 12:21PM PDT. I added <a href="#angularjs--csp">some info</a> about using CSP with AngularJS.</p>

<p>Last Thursday, I published <a href="/blog/2014/09/18/web-security-fundamentals-by-google-peeps/">a blog post</a> in which I summarized the main attack techniques (XSS, CSRF, and MITM) used by baddies to screw with the web. That post also covered two header-based solutions available to help you defend your site: CSP and HSTS. To supplement all that info, I am providing a bunch of articles, references, videos, and tools to help you learn more and take advantage of CSP and HSTS.</p>

<h1 id="content-security-policy-csp">Content Security Policy (CSP)</h1>

<h3 id="browser-support">Browser Support</h3>

<p>Cross-browser support for CSP is <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=contentsecuritypolicy">pretty good</a>. The latest versions of IE require the CSP header to use a special prefix (much like vendor prefixes for certain CSS features). Older crap like IE9 and below have no CSP support.</p>

<h3 id="angularjs--csp">AngularJS + CSP</h3>

<p>Sadly, CSP reduces Angular’s performance because the framework does some optimizations that run afowl of CSP. I imagine that the performance loss shouldn’t be a problem unless you have a ton of Angular expressions on the page at once (e.g., you use <code>ng-repeat</code> to generate hundreds of expressions).</p>

<p>Despite these concerns, CSP is highly recommended by the <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/misc/faq">AngularJS FAQ page</a>. For more info on how to use CSP with AngularJS, check out the <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngCsp">docs for the ngCSP directive</a>.</p>

<h2 id="lusca">Lusca</h2>

<p>Do you use Node.js? Does your Node.js app use Express? Want some middleware to help secure that app? Perhaps you should consider using <a href="https://github.com/krakenjs/lusca">Lusca</a>, a free module created by Paypal to quickly add and configure various security features such as CSP and HSTS. I haven’t personally tried it yet, but I plan to do so soon. Their README file makes Lusca look very easy for devs to use.</p>

<p>You can pick and choose which security features you want to enable. For example, if you’re already using <a href="http://angular-tips.com/blog/2014/05/json-web-tokens-introduction/">JSON Web Tokens</a>, then you may not want to use Lusca’s CSRF method while you take advantage of Lusca’s legacy browser XSS protection.</p>

<p>By the way, don’t get confused: Paypal uses their own open-source, Express-based framework called KrakenJS, but Lusca works with Kraken apps <em>and</em> Express apps.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in late May, I went to one of the most informative tech meetups ever. The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/sfhtml5/">SFHTML5 meetup group</a> organized an event at the Google SF office to cover web security. Google security researchers presented about 2.5 hours of lectures talking about common hacks/attacks, good defense, and the general state of web security.</p>

<p>You can check out the slides here: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/sfhtml5/events/179713932/#event_comment-362704742">click here if you dare.</a> You can watch the lectures here:</p>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>I won’t go into detail about any particular topic.</strong> This blog post will simply get you started in understanding fundamental web security. I suggest you use Google to research more about hacks/attacks or wait for me to post another blog post that provides a collection of links to sweet videos, references, and articles that I found particularly helpful for learning more about all these topics.</p>

<h1 id="be-afraid">Be Afraid</h1>

<p>How are websites and web apps compromised? Why are sites often “hacked”? There are three main types of attacks that you should worry about: XSS, CSRF, and MITM.</p>

<h2 id="cross-site-scripting-xss">Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h2>

<p>When a punk manages to get your code to run their JavaScript, that’s XSS. A simple example is when an unprotected website just accepts text from the user and adds it to the site’s HTML code. If that text is actually JS, then the site ends up sending the browser user-generated code. Damn.</p>

<p>XSS is one of the most common problems plaguing web security today. This is pretty depressing because there are plenty of frameworks and libraries that help fight XSS, but so many site operators just don’t use them and some fools even try to write their own anti-XSS code.</p>

<h2 id="cross-site-request-forgery-xsrfcsrf">Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF/CSRF)</h2>

<p>Let’s say a user logs into your website or web app. They are now authenticated, right? Well it depends. It could be that the user’s <em>browser</em> is authenticated. An attacker could take advantage of this authentication and get the user’s browser to submit an HTTP request crafted with nefarious intentions. The request will be accepted because the browser has the right authentication cookie data, for example.</p>

<p>How is the evil HTTP request initiated? It could be through XSS, it could be through convincing a victim to visit a malicious site that sends HTTP requests, etc. Most examples mention authenticated cookies being used by attackers.</p>

<h2 id="man-in-the-middle-mitm">Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)</h2>

<p>There’s a reason why public internet is unsafe. When you’re on a shared network, other users on the same network can try to intercept your data. Not only can man-in-the-middle attacks read your data, they can also send you bad data/code. Some attackers merely intercept web pages you’re accessing, add more advertisements, and feed you the web page with extra ads. Other attackers might intercept your attempt to visit http://www.facebook.com, give you a fake Facebook login page, and convince you to submit your login info to them.</p>

<p>Obviously, protecting a network by requiring a password to connect can help. However, if you’re using public WiFi in a coffee shop where the password is given to anybody who asks for it, then you’re in trouble again. As I shall mention, HTTPS is crucial for fighting MITM pain.</p>

<h1 id="be-somewhat-less-afraid">Be Somewhat Less Afraid</h1>

<p>It’s great if you’re aware of threats. Now it’s time to learn the basics on how to combat the threats. At the meetup, the Google peeps focused on three types of solutions: frameworks/libraries, CSP, and HTTPS with HSTS. I will also mention a couple other technologies (BONUS) for your consideration.</p>

<h2 id="frameworkslibraries-features">Frameworks/Libraries Features</h2>

<p>One of the Google experts emphasized that XSS is a much bigger problem than it should be because there are so many frameworks and libraries that help fight XSS. He said that no one should be writing their own anti-XSS libraries. Instead, use one of the many open-source solutions. Also, it’s quite possible that you’re already using a framework that has anti-XSS features that just need to be activated or configured.</p>

<p>For example, in some templating libraries, a simple syntax change will enable anti-XSS escaping features. Other templating libraries automatically escape contents by default. Some frameworks like AngularJS do “round-trip escaping on all strings for you” to protect your app from XSS and other injection attacks.</p>

<h2 id="content-security-policy-csp">Content Security Policy (CSP)</h2>

<p>A server can instruct a browser to use a whitelist to decide which resources should be loaded and which should be blocked. This is done when a server adds a CSP to a response header.</p>

<p>For example, a CSP whitelist can tell a browser to trust script files from the server and Google CDNs, images from the server and Amazon CDNs, CSS files from the server, and web fonts from Google. Everything else will be blocked. In-line JavaScript will be blocked, in-line styles will be blocked, images hosted by 3rd parties will be blocked, Flash will be blocked, iframes will be blocked, etc.</p>

<p>Your CSP can be configured based on various types of resources. Check this <a href="http://content-security-policy.com/">CSP Cheatsheet</a> for the list of options. I recommend that you investigate server-side libraries, frameworks, or middleware that can help you implement CSP. When writing your CSP, you can try starting with the most restrictive whitelist and then see what needs to be unblocked.</p>

<h3 id="reporting-feature">Reporting Feature</h3>

<p>You can also set up a reporting system to find out what your CSP has managed to block (thereby identifying failed attacks).</p>

<p>A Googler suggested using the CSP reporting feature <em>without</em> an enforced whitelist to help you examine what browsers are actually digesting when they visit your site or app. For example, you could set up a CSP that has a whitelist and just asks browsers to report non-whitelisted sources without actually blocking them. This gives you the ability to <strong>tweak your whitelist based on production usage without changing production usage</strong>. After you’re done tweaking, change the CSP to force browsers to report <em>and</em> block uninvited resources and content.</p>

}));
</span></span></pre></div>
</div>
 </figure></notextile></div></p>

<h2 id="https-and-http-strict-transport-security-hsts">HTTPS and HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)</h2>

<h3 id="https">HTTPS</h3>

<p>To protect data transfers from MITM attacks, many sites connect to visitors via HTTPS. HTTPS connections not only protect typical payloads like JSON, but also static files and cookies that would otherwise be vulnerable to CSRF attacks. The hard part about using HTTPS is making sure no part of the site ever falls back to unencrypted HTTP.</p>

<p>For example, let’s say you’re browsing a site that provides free icons and graphics. Are all files served over HTTPS? HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are no-brainers. What about images? Yeah that’s pretty standard too. But what about when you get an icon pack? You click a download link, and the browser starts downloading a zip file. Is that using the HTTPS protocol? It’s easy to <a href="http://httpshaming.tumblr.com/">make mistakes</a>.</p>

<h3 id="hsts">HSTS</h3>

<p>Furthermore, what if a user visits the site using HTTP first? It’s pretty common for people to type “somewebsite.com” in the URL bar and the browser will turn that into “http://somewebsite.com”. After they visit that URL, the site can redirect the visitor to “<strong>https</strong>://somewebsite.com”. But sadly, that initial connection via http wasn’t secure. It’s susceptible to a MITM attack.</p>

<p>With HTTP Strict Transport Security, the browser can automatically turn “somewebsite.com” into “<strong>https</strong>://somewebsite.com”. HSTS works by setting a header that tells the browser to enforce HTTPS for requests sent to the domain (“somewebsite.com”) for the next X number of seconds. Yes, you can set X to be a very large number such that HSTS is enforcing HTTPS for the next <em>year</em>, if you want to be cool like that.</p>

<h1 id="stay-tuned">Stay Tuned</h1>

<p>This blog post was getting pretty lengthy, so I decided to split it into two parts. In a follow-up blog post, I will provide a list of references, tutorials, and videos to help you research more about CSP, HSTS, and some complementary tools/libraries.</p>

    <link href="http://RebootJeff.github.io/blog/2014/01/04/queues-stacks-javascript-class-patterns/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-04T16:04:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://RebootJeff.github.io/blog/2014/01/04/queues-stacks-javascript-class-patterns</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="/blog/2013/12/26/queues-and-stacks-in-javascript/">previous post</a>, I began my quest to help noob programmers by introducing the basic computer science topic of data structures. I provided a quick overview of queues and stacks, so please read all about ‘em before engaging your eyeballs with this blog post. This time around, we’ll check out four different patterns for creating classes in JavaScript while learning how to build stacks and queues from scratch.</p>

<p>Before we go, I should warn you that I’m going to focus on describing the class instantiation patterns rather than thoroughly explaining the implementation of the data structures. Just keep in mind that we are going to explore building stacks and queues with objects rather than arrays. More specifically, we will use a property called <code>storage</code> that is an object, not an array. Now I know what you’re pondering.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is a beautiful question. Please ask it all the time (but please don’t troll me by leaving “Why?” in the comments section of this blog post). In this case, the answer to “Why?” may be a tad disatisfying. The answer is “because we can”, but don’t worry! It’ll be fun. Now, let’s start instantiating some motherhugging classes.</p>

<h1 id="functional-instantiation">1. Functional Instantiation</h1>

<p>The simplest way to implement classes is with a “maker” function that creates a new instance of the class and returns that instance so it can be stored as a variable. The new instance is just like any other JavaScript object. It can have properties that store relevant information about the instance (e.g., with a <code>Car</code> class, instances might have a <code>price</code> property). It can also have properties that store functions. These functions serve as <strong>methods</strong> that are tightly associated with the instance.</p>

<h4 id="characteristics">Characteristics</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Creates new copies of the same functions when creating a new instance of the same class. This lack of reuse takes up more memory and can leave an unsavory taste in some programmers’ mouths.</li>
  <li>There is no quick way to modify all instances of the class after they’ve been created. This will become more clear after examining the other instantiation tactics.</li>
  <li>Private variables can be created/used by harnessing <strong>closure scope</strong> superpowers, but I won’t get into that today.</li>
  <li>If you understand JavaScript functions and objects, then you can understand classes implemented via functional instantiation (other instantiation techniques require knowledge of <code>this</code> and/or <code>new</code>).</li>
  <li>Could be used to create callable instances (i.e., the class could return a function rather than an object filled with properties).</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="functional-instantiation-wshared-methods">2. Functional Instantiation w/Shared Methods</h1>

<p>By utilizing an object filled with methods, several classes can be created that have the same methods without creating new copies of said methods. The classes will use their own function references to refer to the same set of shared methods. Therefore, using shared methods eats up less memory than functional instantiation <em>without</em> shared methods.</p>

<h4 id="characteristics-1">Characteristics</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Reuses functions (which conserves memory) by getting function references from a utility such as <a href="http://underscorejs.org/#extend">Underscore.js</a>’s <code>_.extend(instance,methods)</code>.</li>
  <li>Retains the same benefits as functional instantiation <em>without</em> shared methods.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="prototypal-instantiation">3. Prototypal Instantiation</h1>

<p>The key to prototypal instantiation is the use of <code>Object.create()</code> to utilize shared methods. Unlike functional instantiation with shared methods, there is no need to use an <code>extend()</code> function.</p>

<p>While it’s possible to use a prototype’s functions with <code>Object.create(ExampleClass.prototype);</code>, it’s also possible to (ironically) avoid the word “prototype” altogether by using <code>Object.create(sharedMethods);</code>.</p>

<h4 id="characteristics-2">Characteristics</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Reuses shared functions via <code>Object.create(Example.prototype)</code> or <code>Object.create(objectOfFunctions)</code>.</li>
  <li>Unlike functional instantiation, function references are shared. Each instance of the class does not get its own function references that point to the shared methods. This saves even more memory (although it is a very small improvement).</li>
  <li>Unlike functional instantiation, there is no way to use closure scope to enforce privacy of variables.</li>
  <li>Variables are stored on the returned object (aka <code>instance</code>), which means the shared stack methods need to use the keyword <code>this</code> to access the necessary data. It’s not a huge bummer, but if you’re a beginner, then <code>this</code> can be a confusing concept.</li>
  <li>Can use prototype chains for dynamic method modification and inheritance (subclasses!).</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="pseudoclassical-instantiation">4. Pseudoclassical Instantiation</h1>

<p>This is the most commonly used class pattern. It’s also the most complicated because, in addition to using the <code>this</code> keyword, it involves two concepts that the other class patterns don’t require: the <code>new</code> keyword and prototypes. Prototypal instantiation uses prototypes via <code>Object.create()</code>, but pseudoclassical instantiation needs you to explicitly type out <code>ClassName.prototype.methodName</code>, which is just another source of confusion for beginners.</p>

<p>Also, it’s the only class pattern that uses a true <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructor_(object-oriented_programming)">constructor</a> for creating new instances. Other class patterns use instantiator functions that explicitly return a new instance. The pseudoclassical class pattern does not perform such a return thanks to the <code>new</code> keyword.</p>

<h4 id="characteristics-3">Characteristics</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Uses prototype chains to provide methods to instances of a class.</li>
  <li>Allows for dynamic method modification and inheritance (subclasses!) via prototype chains.</li>
  <li>Refers to the instance that’s being created with the <code>this</code> keyword.</li>
  <li>Needs the <code>new</code> keyword to make an instance of a class.</li>
  <li>Has a true constructor that is named with a noun rather than a verb. The name is capitalized.</li>
  <li>Is the most commonly used class pattern.</li>

    <id>http://RebootJeff.github.io/blog/2013/12/26/queues-and-stacks-in-javascript</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The proverbial “they” say (says?) it’s good to write technical blog posts. Blog posts that get down and dirty with the nitty gritty of low-level, in-the-weeds details and nuances accompanied by jargon, acronyms, and name-dropping are all the rage in the dev community. More importantly, I really want to help beginners learn programming, so I may as well teach some basic concepts via my blog. (Later on, I hope to contribute more to <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>, which is a free, open-source, online resource for beginners created by a very cool individual.)</p>

<p>So as my first foray in technical blog posts, I present to all loveable noobs: the introductory data structures known as stacks and queues.</p>

<h1 id="whats-a-stack">What’s a Stack?</h1>

<p>A stack is a collection of items (or data) that follow a particular rule: the last item to join the collection is the first one to leave.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <strong>L</strong>ast data <strong>I</strong>n is the <strong>F</strong>irst data <strong>O</strong>ut (<strong>LIFO</strong>)</li>
  <li>Add data: <strong>push</strong></li>
  <li>Remove data: <strong>pop</strong></li>
  <li>Data enters and exits at the same end of the stack (at the <strong>top</strong>)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ridiculous-analogy">Ridiculous analogy</h2>

<p>Imagine you’ve found an old, abandoned well. You think to yourself, “Bruce Wayne fell down a well when he was a kid, and I wanna be just like the Batman, so I’m gonna fall down this sweet well!” But you hesitate because …it’s a well, and wells are scary, ya know?</p>

<p>Unbeknownst to you, <a href="http://batman.wikia.com/wiki/Harley_Quinn">your arch-nemesis</a> is out walking her <a href="http://batman.wikia.com/wiki/Bud_and_Lou">pet hyenas</a>. She spots you, and quickly runs over to shove you into the well. She giggles in delight at the sight of your plight. She then hides and waits for more people to walk near the well so she can <strong>push</strong> them too.</p>

<p>It just so happens that this well has the diameter of a single person’s width. When someone is pushed into the well, they land on top of the last person who fell in before them. This creates a <strong>stack</strong> of people and some rather pronounced discomfort. Eventually, there are 5 people in this deep-yet-thin well, and you decide it’s time to call for help to get rescued.</p>

<p>To your disappointment, the not-so-dark knight named Superman arrives to pull you well-dwellers out (one at a time). The last one pushed into the well is the first to <strong>pop</strong> out. <em>LIFO.</em></p>

<h1 id="whats-a-queue">What’s a Queue?</h1>

<p>A queue is a collection of items (or data) that follow the real-life “rules” of waiting in a line of people: the first item to join the collection is the first one to leave the collection.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <strong>F</strong>irst data <strong>I</strong>n is the <strong>F</strong>irst data <strong>O</strong>ut (<strong>FIFO</strong>)</li>
  <li>Add data: <strong>enqueue</strong></li>
  <li>Remove data: <strong>dequeue</strong></li>
  <li>Data exits at the: <strong>head</strong> of the queue</li>
  <li>Data enters at the: <strong>tail</strong> of the queue</li>
</ul>

&lt;p&gt;<span class="keyword">var</span> dequeued = queue.shift();  <span class="comment">// “dequeue”</span>

 </figure></notextile></div></p>

<h2 id="ridiculous-analogy-1">Ridiculous analogy</h2>

<p>Batman decides to do some in-the-field combat training. He drops into the middle of a gang meeting and yells, “I’ve sent your buddies to jail. I know you want revenge. Catch me if you can. P.S. I’m Batman!” Why does the cowled hero do this? We all know Batman is a smart dude, and sure enough, he has a clever plan. He lures the baddies who are running after him into a narrow alley.</p>

<p>The gangsters can only approach Batman one at a time to fit in the narrow alley, so they form a line (aka <strong>queue</strong>). The gangster at the front of the line is the first gangster knocked out (aka <strong>dequeued</strong>) by Batman (<strong>first in; first out</strong>). You might even say that Batman’s fists aim for the <strong>head</strong> of the queue and foolish gangsters enter at the <strong>tail</strong> of the line of doom.</p>

<h1 id="the-story-will-continue">The Story Will Continue</h1>

<p>Stay tuned for more blog posts on data structures. My next technical blog post will examine how to implement stacks and queues from scratch (without arrays) to get a deeper understanding of push, pop, enqueue, and dequeue. I know you can’t wait for the moment I deliver on this promise. I can hear your panting through my WiFi, but please stay patient. I was busy working on a <a href="https://github.com/RebootJeff/cocompare">web app</a> and then a <a href="https://github.com/RebootJeff/phone-tag-phonegap">mobile app</a>. Now, I’m busy with job searching while possibly starting mini-project.</p>

<p>On a mildly amusing, unrelated note: isn’t it funny to think about the phrase “stay tuned”? It’s getting rather archaic now that terrestrial, over-the-air TV and radio are losing popularity. Yes, these are the random things I think about as I write blog posts.</p>

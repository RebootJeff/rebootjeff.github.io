<h1>Here We Go</h1>

<p>Dammit. I&rsquo;ve made so many tweaks and adjustments, but I still haven&rsquo;t gotten this blog looking quite right. I&rsquo;m about to get nerdy, so <a href="#jump_whats-next">jump down</a> if you have no sympathy for programmer growing pains.</p>

<p>FYI, I&rsquo;m using <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> to create this blog, <a href="https://github.com/RebootJeff">github</a> to host, and I write posts/pages in a little language called <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/Markdown/">Markdown</a>. Maybe I should&rsquo;ve just created a WordPress blog, but I admit I fell victim to Octopress&rsquo;s tagline: &ldquo;A blogging framework for hackers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some of you non-tech geeks may raise an eyebrow at the term &ldquo;hacker,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s really <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/gba.html">not as evil as you think</a>. The word embodies a more jargon-y connotation as well as the archetype portrayed in the media. In this case, Octopress is appealing to the techy DIY folks who like to have a lot of control over their creations (even at the expense of convenience&hellip;as is definitely the case for me).</p>

<h2>The Tweaks Never End</h2>

<p>I began customizing this blog by adding a lovely Octopress theme. I then tweaked the hell out of it. You can compare and contrast by checking out the theme&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.adrianartiles.com/">original implementation</a>. My changes customized the color scheme, the background image, the size of the hero (i.e., cover photo area on the home page), the Twitter widget, the footer, navigation links, etc.</p>

<p>The customization process was tough because I had never seen a <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers">Liquid</a> setup before. Also, I&rsquo;m fairly new to git, Ruby, and the other bits involved in an Octopress-powered blog. I had to delete, re-install, and re-clone more times than I care to disclose.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m still not done. I still need to tweak the colors and the background image. I want a green theme because I think green is under-used. Unfortunately, it clashes with certain Markdown parts. I switched my blog&rsquo;s Markdown engine to <a href="https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet">Redcarpet</a>, but I still get gross code blocks and lists. I tried using <a href="https://github.com/nono/Jekyll-plugins/blob/master/redcarpet2_markdown.rb">a Redcarpet plugin</a>, but that threw errors during the <code>rake generate</code> process. I tried <a href="http://blog.alestanis.com/2013/02/04/octopress-and-the-twilight-color-scheme/">kramdown</a> with a sweet <a href="https://github.com/danielpietzsch/CodeRay-GitHub-Theme">CodeRay theme</a>, but that setup completely ignored code blocks, block quotes, etc. I need help!</p>

<p>Here are a few examples of the grossness I&rsquo;m talking about:</p>

<pre><code>1. Why is this list
2. such a clashy color?
    a. Why does it have
    b. a background anyway?
</code></pre>

<p>and
```javascript
if thisCodeBlock == &ldquo;ugly&rdquo; then{</p>

<pre><code>console.log("dammit");
</code></pre>

<p>}
```
and</p>

<blockquote><p>quote</p>

<blockquote><p>nested quote</p></blockquote>

<p>These quotes actually aren&rsquo;t too gaudy.</p></blockquote>

<h1>TL;DR</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m whining about how difficult it can be to use a DIY path, but it&rsquo;s really helped me learn a lot. So it&rsquo;s all good.</p>

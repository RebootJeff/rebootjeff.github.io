<p>In this blog post, I’m going to cover some basic info and tips about applications and interviews for coding bootcamps. The bootcamps are selective programs. Read on if you’re curious about the application process and/or if you need some help preparing for interviews.</p>

<p>I can only provide my thoughts based on applying to Coding Dojo, Hack Reactor, RocketU, General Assemby, and App Academy. This blog post won’t be very bootcamp-specific, but in part 2 of 2, I will write detailed descriptions of my personal application and interview experiences.</p>

<h1 id="applications">Applications</h1>

<p>I filled out applications for RocketU and Coding Dojo first. Then I submitted applications for Hack Reactor, General Assembly, and App Academy. All applications consisted of web forms that were fairly straightforward, but some included interesting mini-essays. You can visit their respective websites and find the forms yourself, but I just want to mention that they aren’t too time-consuming.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I heard Dev Bootcamp’s application asks you to make a video of yourself so they can check out your personality. That might be a bit more time consuming. I didn’t bother applying to Dev Bootcamp because I wanted to enroll in a bootcamp program ASAP, but Dev Bootcamp’s application page shows their classes are sold out for the next 6 months!</p>

<h2 id="check-for-dates">Check for dates</h2>

<p>That reminds me: you should check to see what dates are available. Unfortunately, not all sites make it crystal clear. You might waste a lot of time reading a website only to find out later that their next open enrollment is too late for you.</p>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

<p>Note: These examples will probably be out-dated within a year or so. I imagine these companies will change their websites in due time.</p>

<p><a href="http://apply.devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp</a> - Their website doesn’t tell you they’re sold out for 6 months until you reach their application page, which you probably won’t do until you’ve read a lot of the other pages on their site.</p>

<p><a href="http://hackreactor.com/">Hack Reactor</a> - You have to scroll down about 33% of their single-page website before you find their start dates in a section entitled <em>The Program</em>. When I was just skimming, I missed these dates because my eyes were naturally drawn to the big jQuery, HTML5, etc. logos displayed just below the dates.</p>

<p><a href="http://codingdojo.co/">Coding Dojo</a> - They actually show their next start date right away. The first thing you read on their website is when, where, and how much does it cost. Good job, Dojo!</p>

<p><a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive/san-francisco">General Assembly</a> - A navigation bar at the top helps you skip to the <em>Schedule</em> list of available dates.</p>

<p><a href="http://rocket-space.com/rocketu/#bootcamp">RocketU</a> - The RocketU single-page website shows info about their non-bootcamp programs before getting to the bootcamp overview. They provide a navigation link to jump to the bootcamp info, and that’s when you’re greeted with next available start date and tuition cost. Not bad.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.appacademy.io/applications/new">App Academy</a> - Their navigation bar at the top of the page includes a link to dates. Their application allows you to appy to multiple dates. Nice touch! I don’t remember if any other applications have that ability.</p>

<h2 id="dont-fret-for-about-one-week">Don’t fret for about one week</h2>

<p>Also, you should relax after submitting an application because <strong>it took 2-7 days for the bootcamps to respond to my applications.</strong> I think some bootcamps provided automatic confirmation emails to let me know they got my application, but if I recall correctly, at least one bootcamp didn’t give me any sanity-fostering confirmation email.</p>

<p>If you don’t hear back from a bootcamp right away, keep in mind that they’re flooded with applications. I suggest waiting a week for them to respond to you before sending any followup emails.</p>

<h1 id="interviews">Interviews</h1>

<p>It’s important to consider that <strong>the interview process is as much an opportunity for them to wow you as it is a time for you to impress them.</strong> This is why I looked forward to each interview. I couldn’t wait to be wowed.</p>

<p>Before each interview, I reviewed my research on the particular bootcamp. I re-visited the bootcamp’s website and their blog to find nuggets of info worth asking them about. A lot of my questions probed for elaboration on something very specific to the bootcamp in question.</p>

<p>I had handful of standard questions about logistics, a few questions comparing them against their competitors, questions about curriculae, etc. You can find a list of questions at the end of this blog post. I didn’t ask all my prepared questions though. Sometimes, you need to evaluate how your interview conversations are flowing. I can’t say I flawlessly navigated these conversations, but I made conscious decisions to ask or not ask certain questions as the circumstances required.</p>

<h2 id="my-interviewing-advice">My interviewing advice</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Write down a ton of questions to ask for the final half/third of your interview. Asking a lot of questions makes you look AWESOME.
    <ul>
      <li>Ask questions that show you’re planning ahead (i.e., questions about logistics).</li>
      <li>Ask questions that show you’re serious (i.e., very specific/thoughtful questions).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Be prepared to answer basic questions that you already answered in your application forms. Examples:
    <ul>
      <li>Why do you want to do a bootcamp?</li>
      <li>How did you hear about us?</li>
      <li>Why do you want to learn to code?</li>
      <li>Can you handle the intensity of our program? Are you sure? Are you sure you’re sure?</li>
      <li>What prior programming experience do you have?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Do NOT panic during the technical portion of the interviews. If you don’t know something, just admit it. They don’t expect you to be an expert; they just want to see how much you know so far by asking progressively harder questions until they get to topics beyond your current experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>I panicked a bit in my Hack Reactor and RocketU interviews. In both cases, the interviewer was nice and helped me out. In both cases, I walked out with positive vibes.</p>

<h1 id="interview-questions-for-you-to-ask">Interview questions for YOU to ask</h1>

<p>You might think it’s hard to come up with interesting questions. I used to think that way, but then I stopped being cynical for 2 seconds so then my mind could do some brainstorming. Here are a few ideas for finding inspiration:</p>

<h2 id="question-topics">Question Topics</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Ask questions about something interesting mentioned on the bootcamp’s blog.</li>
  <li>Ask questions about specific topics covered by their curriculum.</li>
  <li>Find the interviewer’s LinkedIn profile or Twitter feed. You might find something cool to ask about.</li>
  <li>Ask for examples of something they brag about (e.g., if they brag about guest speakers or networking events ask more about those).</li>
  <li>Check out <a href="/blog/2013/09/04/coding-bootcamp-research-how-to-compare-bootcamps/">my list of factors</a>. Formulate questions about them.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="examples-1">Examples</h2>

<h3 id="logistics">Logistics</h3>

<ul>
  <li>What are the exact start and end* dates for the cohort that starts in (INSERT MONTH HERE)?
    <ul>
      <li>*Note: Some bootcamps don’t provide end dates on their websites.</li>
      <li>Are there any holidays or breaks?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How many students and teachers are there?</li>
  <li>Does the bootcamp use a rolling cohort system?</li>
  <li>What are a typical day’s hours?
    <ul>
      <li>What percentage of students stay extra late?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What are your payment plans/options?
    <ul>
      <li>Do you have a refund policy?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Are there any special requirements?
    <ul>
      <li>Do I need a Mac/Linux?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="qualifications">Qualifications</h3>
<ul>
  <li>What kind of industry experience do the faculty have?</li>
  <li>How do you help students find jobs?</li>
  <li>How often do students find jobs after graduation?</li>
  <li>Do you have any hiring/company partners?</li>
  <li>Do you conduct any alumni outreach?
    <ul>
      <li>What kind of support do you provide to alumni?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What are the roles of the various faculty/staff members?
    <ul>
      <li>How much attention will I get from lead instructors versus part-time instructors versus junior assistants?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="technical">Technical</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Why did you choose to cover language X instead of language Y?</li>
  <li>How much of the curriculum features group projects versus individual projects versus quick assignments?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="personalityculturevision">Personality/Culture/Vision</h3>
<ul>
  <li>What’s your favorite bootcamp-hosted event?
    <ul>
      <li>E.g., fire-side chat, guest speaker, social event, networking event, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Why did you decide to work for the bootcamp?</li>
  <li>What is your favorite part (aka sprint) of the curriculum?</li>
  <li>What personality traits do your students have in common?
    <ul>
      <li>How much experience do your students have before starting the course?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Do you ever kick out students? (You may want to re-phrase this question to be less blunt)
    <ul>
      <li>How do you help struggling students?</li>
      <li>How do you ensure no students fall behind?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What are you doing to improve the bootcamp?
    <ul>
      <li>Are you hiring more teachers? Extra staff? Specialized staff (e.g., job hunting, alumni outreach, etc)?</li>
      <li>Are you expanding into other cities/locations?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="how-do-you-research-bootcamps">How do you research bootcamps?</h1>
<p>When you’re about to buy a car, you gather relevant data by going to KBB, Edmunds, and other sites. You read editorial reviews and watch video reviews. You can investigate possible issues by searching forums and recall databases.</p>

<p>When comparing cars, you consider fuel economy, reliability, style, and niceties. When comparing any big expenditure, you consider price and value. As for determining which aspects of a car really matter to you the most, it’s pretty intuitive to just think about your daily life.</p>

<p>So what do you do when “shopping” for a coding bootcamp? It’s a lot like shopping for cars, choosing a university, or making any other big decision: it’s time-consuming, it can be overwhelming, and there’s a ton of info for your consideration. However, it’s pretty easy to learn how to research cars and colleges thanks to the abundance of resources out there –but bootcamps are new, so it’s no surprise that learning how to research them seems mysterious. I’m going to help you.</p>

<p>When I started looking at coding bootcamps, I wasn’t sure what to do other than basic Googling and looking at compay websites. This blog post serves as an examination of how to examine bootcamps.</p>

<h1 id="what-factors-should-you-consider">What factors should you consider?</h1>
<p>I’m not claiming you need to thoroughly analyze every item in the list below. Just like any other big decision, you need to prioritize various factors based on your own preferences and needs.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Curriculum:</strong> What will you learn? How will you learn it?
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Technical Skills:</strong>
  Which programming languages will be taught? What tools of the trade will you learn? What about Test Driven Development (TDD)? How many frameworks will you be exposed to?</li>
      <li><strong>Non-Tech Skills:</strong> Does the bootcamp cover job interview prep? Paired programming? Presentation experience? Resume workshops? Listening skills?</li>
      <li><strong>Intensity:</strong> How much time is devoted to various topics? How difficult is the bootcamp relative to other bootcamps?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Faculty:</strong> How many teachers are employed by the bootcamp? What qualifies them to teach you and earn your money?</li>
  <li><strong>Job Placement:</strong> Other than teaching you relevant skills, how can a bootcamp help you get a job?
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Alumni Success:</strong> What kinds of careers have previous students earned after attending the bootcamp (employment rate)?</li>
      <li><strong>Network:</strong> How well-connected is the bootcamp? How many employers are in touch with the program?</li>
      <li><strong>Image:</strong> What kind of reputation does course have? Are employers familiar with the brand?</li>
      <li><strong>Initiatives:</strong> Does the bootcamp conduct a hiring day? How many employers show up to the hiring day? Does the bootcamp offer job interview training? Does the bootcamp have a staff member dedicated to helping you find a job?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Schedule:</strong> Is there any flexibility in when you work? Are there any days off? Holidays?
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Typical Day:</strong> Students often dedicate more than 8 hours per day, but what about faculty? Will the long hours make it difficult to commute?</li>
      <li><strong>Start &amp; End Dates:</strong> Do you want to get started right away? If so, the start date surely matters. The end date might affect your ability to find a job ASAP. What if the end date is right around the end of employers’ fiscal years?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Cost:</strong> How does a bootcamp’s price compare to its competitors? Why did they choose a particular price?
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Payment Plans:</strong> What’s the initial deposit? Do you pay in chunks, or all at once upfront? Can you defer payment until after a certain date?</li>
      <li><strong>Discounts:</strong> Are there any scholarships for minorities/females? Are there any refunds or partial refunds upon getting hired by their employer network?</li>
      <li><strong>Value:</strong> How much faculty time do you get for your money? Does the bootcamp provide computers? Does the bootcamp provide extra nice office space?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Facilities:</strong> Speaking of office space, are the facilities boring, or do they add to the learning experience? Where are they located? Will the location involve high commute costs? How feasible is it to live in a hostel near the bootcamp?</li>
  <li><strong>Character:</strong> Does the bootcamp feel like a startup, a corporate player, or an amateur hour?
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Personalities:</strong> What’s the culture like? Do they welcome total noobs, or do they demand demonstrable coding experience?</li>
      <li><strong>Long-Term Vision:</strong> How does the bootcamp treat its alumni? Does the bootcamp plan on expanding its territory or re-investing in a single location?</li>
      <li><strong>Extras &amp; Perks:</strong> Free wifi? Duh. Free lunch? Oh nice. Organized outings? Sports? Happy hours? Guest lectures from industry experts?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="how-do-you-prioritize-factors">How do you prioritize factors?</h1>
<p>Not only do you want to know what factors to consider, but you also want to know how much you should care.</p>

<p>For factors like cost and location of facilities, it’s obvious how to think about their impacts relative to your life. For factors such as curriculum and long-term vision, it can be hard to figure out what matters to you. Should you look for a bootcamp that focuses on Ruby on Rails or Python with Django? Should you believe it when people say picking a programming language doesn’t matter?</p>

<p>Other factors might actually surprise you once you dig into them. For example, it might bother you to find out that some of your tuition/time is being spent on <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/2013/01/30/yoga-panic-pandas-3-things-you-might-not-expect-from-a-programming-bootcamp/">mandatory yoga</a> classes.</p>

<p>(For the record, I like the idea of mandatory yoga, but I’ve seen <a href="http://qr.ae/IL5Mc">negative reactions</a> to the fact.)</p>

<p>I will try to explore the question of “how do you prioritize factors?” in much greater detail in upcoming blog posts that focus on a few factors at a time.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-you-gather-info">How do you gather info?</h1>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bootcamp website:</strong> Most bootcamp websites provide an overview of curriculum, tuition, etc. They don’t always do a good job of telling you the quality of their faculty or the typical day schedule.</li>
  <li><strong>Comparison sites:</strong> A pair of new websites have been created to help you compare bootcamps by providing spec sheets. They don’t do a good job of providing info on bootcamp culture. What’s nice is that they have reviews, but the reviews basically feel like Quora comments.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://bootcamps.in">bootcamps.in</a>: Has a few helpful articles and a big list of self-education resources.</li>
      <li><a href="http://bootcamper.io">bootcamper.io</a>: No articles, but cleaner aesthetics and better layout.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Quora:</strong> This is a fantastic resource if you want to hear from both students and co-founders. I’ve seen a lot of posts by founders of Dev Bootcamp, RocketU, Hack Reactor, and a few non-San Francisco bootcamps. Some posts feel like advertisements, but some feel like authentic, honest nuggets of insight.</li>
  <li><strong>Student blogs:</strong> There are a lot of blogs out there by current and former students. They often cover curriculum details. They sometimes talk about bootcamp culture. It’s nice to read success stories, but you might also find tales of unfulfilled expectations.</li>
  <li><strong>YouTube and Vimeo:</strong> Searching for videos can help you find out more about a bootcamp’s facilities, student personalities, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Admissions interviews:</strong> These are going to be your best chance to get your questions answered about typical day schedule, payment options, job placement, etc. Just keep in mind that the answers are biased.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also find press coverage of bootcamps, but I’ve found that they generally fail to give you much insight. Most articles are just explaining what a coding bootcamp is. Some press coverage involves video interviews and whatnot. Those are worth watching because even though they’re edited fluff pieces, they still give a glimpse into personalities and facilities.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.checkio.org/">CheckiO</a> is a website that aims to teach programming by providing an online gaming world with some social features heavily emphasized. CheckiO is meant for beginners and experts alike, but all coding challenges must be completed in Python.</p>

<p>The creators have quite a bit of hype behind them. They have received hundreds of thousands of dollars in funding. They have cultivated a thriving community of users. So yeah, my interest was piqued.</p>

<iframe width="300" height="169" src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kWoW6RgH04g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Side note: The site doesn’t seem to use secure HTTPS. It lets you log in with your other social media and developer community accounts (Facebook, Twitter, WordPress, GitHub, Stack Exchange, etc) so does that mean it’s safer to log in with a Twitter account rather than with a native CheckiO account?</p>

<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>

<p>I did not play with CheckiO for more than a few hours, so that’s why I call this blog post a mini-review.</p>

<p>I think giving it a couple of hours is enough to pass judgement considering that most users will probably give up or continue based on their initial 10 minutes on the site. But my point is that it’s possible that CheckiO is a much deeper, richer website if you’re patient enough to explore it.</p>

<h1 id="what-i-thought">What I Thought</h1>

<p>It looks like the CheckiO community is quite strong, but the site is designed to attract users with a visual wow factor that is misleading. The visuals don’t really tie into the actual coding experience very well. It reminds me of when I first tried Neopets. I was disappointed to find that interaction with the pets was limited to static interaction rather than real-time, animated interactions.</p>

<p>Although the visuals of the CheckiO world seem to be geared towards attracting a younger crowd, that potential user base will be deterred by the detachment of said world. Try as they might, the creators of CheckiO fail to make the world, the backstory, the characters, etc. feel relevant when facing a coding challenge. It’s kind of like how some action movies and video games have plots that barely exist because the creators focused more on the action than the story. I get the sense that the creators of CheckiO are actually trying hard to make their story feel relevant, but it’s just not working for me.</p>

<p>In other words, CheckiO wants to prevent users from thinking it’s just another site full of coding challenges by showering the experience with cool graphics and a backstory. They want you to think it’s an edutainment experience rather than a purely academic one. They want you to think CheckiO is a game rather than a series of assignment akin to homework, but it just doesn’t feel like a video game.</p>

<p>The bulk of the experience is not something that could be described as “gameplay.” The in-browser IDE screams “boring” when compared to the home screen presented after logging in. This is a big bummer because everything you see leading up to a coding challenge makes you think you’re about to see something really cool and interactive. It actually makes me think I’m about to see a mini-game. Instead, you end up setting your eyes on a very unappealing IDE.</p>

<p>Despite its attempts to the contrary, CheckiO is just another site full of coding challenges. The challenges are fun for people who already enjoy programming, but the site just doesn’t live up to its potential to reach out to a new, bigger, untapped audience. The user experience really needs to be remade to properly engage users quickly. Instead, it leaves you a bit confused because it looks like a site full of features and gamification, but you can’t quite figure out how to enjoy the benefits.</p>

<p>Given the current success earned by CheckiO, I have a feeling more patient yields more rewards when using the site, but I still have a hard time imagining that “coding on CheckiO” could ever be described as “playing CheckiO.” I feel bad to give CheckiO a thumbs down because they’re the type of underdog with the type of good intentions that I want to support.</p>

<h2 id="woo">Woo!</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Thriving international community</li>
  <li>Fun coding challenges</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="boo">Boo!</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Long load times</li>
  <li>Tangled navigation</li>
  <li>Omg bubbly/glassy UI is so 2009 duh</li>
  <li>Solutions not displayed for first few challenges (even after you pass them)</li>
  <li>The weird capitalization in the brand name “CheckiO” bothers me :p</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/hackreactorlogo_SP.png" alt="Hack Reactor logo" /></p>

<p class="my-caption">Image Credits:  <a href="https://hackreactor.eventbrite.com/">Hack Reactor</a></p>

<p>I have enrolled in the September 23, 2013 cohort of <a href="http://hackreactor.com">Hack Reactor</a> (aka HackR), which is a 12-week coding bootcamp (or “academy” as they say) located in downtown San Francisco. I will pay them thousands of dollars so I can spend about 72-80 hours/week training, learning, and exploring –all in an attempt to gain the skills of a software developer (with a focus on web tech).</p>

<h1 id="hold-up-whats-a-coding-bootcamp">Hold up. What’s a coding bootcamp?</h1>
<p>Coding bootcamps are training courses that teach students the fundamentals needed to become immediately employable in some field of programming (generally web development, but some bootcamps focus on smartphone apps). Most bootcamps require full-time commitment (you must quit your job) and are pretty intense. Students generally “work” for more than 40 hours per week.</p>

<p>I put “work” in quotes because it in this case, I’m using the word to cover many different things that happen in a typical day at a bootcamp. Students listen to lectures by faculty and guest speakers. Students program in pairs. Students study and complete assignments. Most importantly, students get a ton of hands-on learning experience. Bootcamp curriculae typically involve projects that help students establish a portfolio of apps.</p>

<p>Bootcamps are a great option for people who want to switch from a non-computer science career to a programming-heavy career. That said, there will be some CS grads in some bootcamps because college often neglects to teach relevant hard skills like how to use git.</p>

<p>Coding bootcamps are also called programming bootcamps, developer/dev bootcamps, etc. The term “bootcamp” is sometimes replaced with “immersive course” or just “immersive.”</p>

<p>Check out this video to get a sense of the Hack Reactor vibe:</p>

<iframe width="300" height="169" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ko9bXImNirE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<h1 id="why-pick-hack-reactor">Why pick Hack Reactor?</h1>
<p>In the coming days and weeks, I am going to extensively blog about my experience researching different bootcamps in a series unsurprisingly entitled <a href="/blog/categories/bootcamp-research/">Coding Bootcamp Research</a>. The series will cover all the ins and outs of how I examined my options, the admissions processes, and my decision to choose HackR over its competitors.</p>

<p>To give you the gist of it, I chose HackR because it seems to produce the smartest bootcamp “grads” through a combination of high quality faculty/curriculum and lots of time. What I mean by “lots of time” is that faculty are on the clock from 9am-8pm x 6 days/week instead of the typical 9am-6pm x 5 days/week found at other bootcamps.</p>

<p>The claim that HackR has the best grads is backed up by…more claims. They claim that 100% of their grads find a developer job within 3 months after graduation. They claim that the average starting salary of their alumni is somewhere around $100,000 (I don’t remember the exact dollar amount because the raw amount matters less than how high it ranks). No other bootcamps claim to have such high levels of success.</p>

<p>Why should I believe Hack Reactor? Because I trust them. And I would normally litter such claims in my blog with relevant links, but the previous few paragraphs lack links because I will simply discuss these things in much greater detail in future blog posts.</p>

<p>I have a lot to say regarding HackR’s pros and cons. I have a lot to say about the pros and cons of App Academy, Coding Dojo, General Assembly, Dev Bootcamp, and the brand new RocketU as well. So stay tuned.</p>

<h1 id="so-what-now">So… what now?</h1>
<p>I have about a month of funemployment left before HackR dominates my life. During that time, I have to deal with financial concerns, HackR introductory homework, and my own personal goals.</p>

<h2 id="money-money-money-moneyey">Money, money, money (moneyey!)</h2>
<p>This is about to get a bit personal, so prepare thyself.</p>

<p>I need to deal with tuition. $2,000 down. $15,780 to go. In the word of the great philosopher, Bart Simpson: “Eep.” Luckily, my mom has offered to cover my tuition. At first, I was reluctant to accept. After all, I have the money…sort of (most of my money is in stocks). I wouldn’t have much left over if I paid tuition myself, but the real reason I hesitated to accept my mom’s generosity was based on principle.</p>

<p>I like being independent in many ways. Financial independence is one of those ways.</p>

<p>I often question what my mom thinks rather than just accepting her ideas at face value. I changed my mind about her offer by using a thought process I use whenever I encounter this questioning that routinely visits my mind. The process is simple. I ask myself, <strong>“How would I feel if I were the parent?”</strong> Obviously, I easily consider what happens when I’m the child. So when I consider the parent perspective, I can imagine being a parent considering the child perspective too.</p>

<p>But let’s not get too cyclical/meta because I was telling a story that actually has an ending.</p>

<p>As I thought about things from the view of my hypothetical, futuristic, child-rearing mind, I realized that if I were in my mom’s shoes, I would very much want my son to accept my money. The reason? Principle.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OMG @RebootJeff just paradoxed himself #WTF #ICallBS #hypocrisy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shut up and listen. You can posit that I’m merely rationlizing a money-grubbing stance, and I know that’s what it looks like, but I hold myself obligated to meet the same standards and expectations when I’m finally a parent. In this case, the expectation I’m talking about is the responsibility (and deep desire) to help my child <del>become a Neil deGrasse Tyson badass</del> get really awesome education.</p>

<p>Not to mention, my family has that traditional Asian risk-aversion baked into its collective mind. However, as my mom pointed out, pursuing fantastic educational opportunities shouldn’t be considered a (financial) risk to avoid if the parent can help out.</p>

<h2 id="the-curriculum-begins-now">The curriculum begins now</h2>
<p>There are a few tasks to accomplish prior to the first day of class other than making HackR rich(er). The bootcamp’s pre-course work requires about 90 hours of dedication (about 50 hours mandatory + about 40 hours optional). I’ve been instructed to…</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Complete a lot of <a href="http://codeschool.com">Code School</a> tutorials (which is a bit of a bummer because I’m tired of online tutorials).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learn more JavaScript through some TDD challenges using Jasmine and Mocha (I don’t know what these are if they’re not hot beverages).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learn about git via various videos and tutorials (which should be easy because I already know some git).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Build a basic Twitter clone (which sounds so difficult that I can’t wait to do it –what an odd feeling).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Check out a list of optional online resources.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="my-own-pre-course-to-do-list">My own pre-course to-do list</h2>
<p>I plan on completing most of the optional pre-course work (in addition to the mandatory parts), but I also hope to make time for some other pre-course goals of mine. Maybe some are covered by the pre-course work, but here’s a comprehensive list:</p>

<h3 id="relevant">Relevant</h3>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>In SF for the week. Heading to the east bay Ruby group tomorrow and speaking at the SF Ruby group Thursday if you want to come say hello.</p>&mdash; Gregg Pollack (@greggpollack) <a href="https://twitter.com/greggpollack/statuses/369523580796542978">August 19, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div>

<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://chartboost.com">Chartboost</a> hosted a presentation by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/greggpollack">Gregg Pollack</a>, founder of <a href="http://www.codeschool.com">Code School</a> and <a href="http://envylabs.com">Envy Labs</a>. I found this event by joining <a href="http://www.meetup.com/sfruby/events/131917612/">The San Francisco Ruby Meetup Group</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>The slides + audio recording can be found here: <a href="http://penxy.com/qeh">http://penxy.com/qeh</a></em></strong></p>

<p>The talk Pollack provided was not very technical in nature. He mostly focused on general productivity, communication, and other soft skills rather than discussing hard skills. Therefore, the talk had a self-help or self-improvement vibe –as opposed to an academic one.</p>

<h1 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h1>
<p>I didn’t plan on going into as much detail as I did in my <a href="/blog/2013/08/10/event-review-intro-to-ux-at-general-assembly/">previous event review</a> because you can check out the presentation for yourself in the penxy link I already provided. However, the penxy recording failed to capture the last 2 out of 12 steps. It also missed the conclusion. I also like to ramble.</p>

<h2 id="the-12-steps-to-be-a-better-developer">The 12 steps to be a better developer</h2>

<pre><code>1. Set expectation
2. Be mindful of your engineering background
3. Software development is a craft
4. Learn how to delegate and improve the system
5. Continue to learn inside and outside your company
6. Stay out of your comfort zone
7. Make friends and build relationships
8. Don't be afraid to ask for help
9. Learn to eliminate distractions and get in the zone
10. The most complex solution is rarely the best solution
11. Communicate visually
12. Understand what brings happiness
</code></pre>

<h2 id="my-reinterpretation-of-the-12-steps">My (re)interpretation of the 12 steps</h2>
<p>I think a lot of Gregg Pollack’s steps are good, a few are great, but a lot are poorly worded. Ok, they’re not “poorly worded” per se, but some seem a tad cryptic. It’s almost as if Pollack picked partially enigmatic titles on purpose, allowing him to turn a 12-step list into a 1-hour presentation. Almost.</p>

<p>To be fair, I don’t think he has nefarious intentions, but I disagree with the wording of the 12 steps enough to motivate me to re-present them with different diction.</p>

<h3 id="pay-more-attention-to-communicating-expectations">1. Pay more attention to communicating <em>expectations</em></h3>
<p>Everyone knows communication is important. Pollack takes the time to suggest you spend more attention on communication with clients with a focus on expectations. Pollack posits that you think about some failed projects and consider that a possible (perhaps probable?) cause of failure was mismatched expectations.</p>

<p>You can preempt this problem by obtaining client feedback more often, being geographically closer to the client, and by having someone on the client’s team become part of your team (as a liason, I imagine). By the way, Pollack often frames his ideas in the context of client-consultant relationships due to his experience running a consultancy.</p>

<h3 id="avoid-criticizing-people">2. Avoid <em>criticizing</em> people</h3>
<p>Here’s another bit regarding communication: don’t forget other people don’t think like you do. Pollack specifically points out that engineers need to be cognizant of the simple fact that non-engineers think differently, and if you don’t account for the difference, then you may “kill collaboration.”</p>

<p>At this point, Pollack mostly discussed the problem of “diagnosing problems” and criticizing others. I actually started reading the oft-cited <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People">How to Win Friends and Influence People</a></em>, and the concept of criticism is covered in one of the early chapters. Lesson learned: most people simply cannot handle criticism.</p>

<p>Pollack recommends rephrasing your criticism into additions to another’s ideas rather than subtractions. I think that’s a bit crazy, but what do I know? I admit my less-than-4 years of work experience don’t make me an expert in workplace communication. On one hand, I agree that cold-and-calculating communication may seem efficient to engineers, but it just sounds asshole-y to most people. In other words, learn some empathy skills and put them to use in the workplace! On the other hand, I think the technique of rephrasing criticism into “Yes, and …” statements involves too much hand holding, and you will fail to convey your points because they are too busy treating the diabeetus caused by all the sugarcoating (TIL: “sugarcoating” is only one word).</p>

<p>Before moving on to the next step, Pollack briefly discussed the awesome warm-fuzzies derived from good listening skills. I concur with his thoughts on good listening.</p>

<h3 id="a-good-developer-builds-what-others-want">3. A good developer builds what <em>others</em> want</h3>
<p>Why did Pollack include this step? This step was presented more as a way to help describe the role of developers, but it doesn’t really help you become a better developer in my opinion.</p>

<p>So what did Pollack say exactly? Well, he essentially said the customer’s needs come first, but he just worded it differently. He said it’s a developer’s job to take whatever canvas they’re given and make something awesome. He cited a Walt Disney quote about building things for the sake of others –not for yourself. He said a lot of things without providing examples of actions you can take to improve your quality as a developer. Boo. I guess his point is just that you should stop whining and get over yourself?</p>

<h3 id="delegate-work-pretty-straightforward-stuff">4. Delegate work (pretty straightforward stuff)</h3>
<p>Everyone is familiar with cautionary tales about over-burdening oneself. Everyone knows you need to hire people to prevent you from tasking too many multis (so to speak). Everyone knows about the significance of delegation.</p>

<p>But section 4 of this talk was not wholly uninsightful. He provided an example of “doing the math” by talking about framing delegation in terms of hours saved. His example involved a snazzy company that hired a full-time barista to take care of coffee for everyone else. After guesstimating some numbers, Pollack posited that the 8-hour barista added 20 hours of development productivity at the relatively low cost of a barista’s wages.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>WITHOUT barista: 80 employees x 1 cup of coffee per employee x 15 minutes of time used to get each cup of coffee = 20 hours per day spent on coffee
(not an exact quote, but you get the point)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a sometimes smartass-y skeptic, I take issue with his guesstimates. More importantly, I’d like to point out that the 15 minutes spent on getting coffee is probably considered as a break that employees enjoy. They will likely find a new way to take a break if you shorten the amount of time it takes to get their caffeine buzz. To be fair, this is something that Pollack acknowledges (somewhat) in a later section of his talk, so I shall holster my quick-draw revolver named Wise Guy.</p>

<h3 id="remember-extracurriculars-do-them">5. Remember <em>extracurriculars</em>? Do them.</h3>
<p>This is a two-parter. First, Pollack highly recommends attending meetups, seminars, talks, conferences, etc. that are relevant to software development. He also recommended further academic learning through resources like Code School	 of course. Second, your company should foster internal knowledge transfer via internal brown bags, “What I’m Working On Now” presentations, retrospectives, book clubs, planned pair programming, and even just eating meals together.</p>

<p>One tidbit that I found interesting was that Pollack said it’s worth mentioning to hiring managers and bosses that you like attending meetups and whatnot. Bonus points!</p>

<h3 id="embrace-challenging-tasks-avoid-embracing-trite-crap">6. Embrace <em>challenging</em> tasks; avoid embracing trite crap</h3>
<p>Pollack claimed that human nature causes us to embrace easy-to-accomplish goals and tasks such as responding to work emails. This can lead to traps where you feel productive by doing a lot of small, low-value tasks. To avoid these traps, plan your day around addressing the big challenges first –don’t procrastinate by scheduling the tough stuff after the easy stuff.</p>

<p>On a higher level, it’s important to embrace tough challenges for the sake of keeping your brain fit, keeping your skills up-to-date, accomplishing meaningful work, etc.</p>

<h3 id="nurture-friendships-with-co-workers">7. Nurture <em>friendships</em> with co-workers</h3>
<p>Many forget that one way to make the developer community better is to make friends in the community. One way to make workplace collaboration better is to become better friends with co-workers.</p>

<p>At this point, Pollack quickly discussed introversion/shyness (as an audience member later pointed out, introversion != shyness). He provided some social skill tips like establishing personal goals to meet 5 new people per meetup, for example. When meeting new people, Pollack’s main tactic is to ask them about themselves. I think we’ve all heard that advice before. My take on it is that it works, but it still feels awkward until the conversation gets through the first few minutes of chilliness.</p>

<h3 id="ask-for-help-sooner-than-later">8. Ask for help <em>sooner</em> than later</h3>
<p>We’ve all heard it before: if you don’t ask for help now, you’ll struggle with your issue for much longer by going solo. Pollack’s rule of thumb is to ask for help after trying to tackle a bug, obstacle, etc. on your own for 30 minutes. If a small problem is taking you more than 30 minutes to solve, it probably means you’re using the wrong approach anyway (i.e., you’re digging yourself into a deeper hole).</p>

<h3 id="take-breaks-and-avoid-synchronous-communication">9. Take <em>breaks</em> and avoid synchronous communication</h3>
<p>I like Pollacks claim that optimal work hours are 80% productive and 20% (unproductive) fun. Companies should embrace breaks and create a work environment that acknowledges employees’ “need” to check Facebook at work. But employees shouldn’t just take breaks while at the office, they should take breaks <em>from</em> the office by working at alternative locations such as coffee shops.</p>

<p>In step 9, Pollack also talked about abandoning synchronous communication like IM for asynchornous communications like email. He said IM can be a problem because it interrupts your train of thought whenever someone contacts you. Upon interruption, you’ll be tempted to check email or do other less intellectual work. It’s a bit weird to me that Pollack basically grouped “avoid distractions” with “take breaks” in step 9. They seem unrelated enough to warrant separation, but oh well.</p>

<h3 id="make-sure-you-dont-over-engineer-your-software">10. Make sure you don’t <em>over-engineer</em> your software</h3>
<p>It’s easy to get stuck spending lots of time on optimization, worrying about handling heavy load, predicting future requirements, and expanding “just in case” feature sets. Pollack went so far as to suggest not worrying about optimization or heavy loads until your software starts buckling under the pressure of intense usage. Do I agree? I’m afraid I’m too ignorant at this point to really have an opinion.</p>

<h3 id="use-visual-communication-not-just-text-based-comms">11. Use <em>visual</em> communication, not just text-based comms</h3>
<p>You might love email. Your client might love email. But sometimes, it’s hard to really describe a feature or a bug through text alone. Pollack is in love with the idea of not only attaching annotated screenshots, but also sending screencasts.</p>

<p>I had never really thought about screencasting as a form of regular, commonplace communication, but it makes a ton of sense. The key is to limit yourself to 5-minute videos recorded in a single take. Such screencasts may be rough around the edges, but they can still drive a point home faster and harder than a simple email.</p>

<p>Additionally, screencasts provide other benefits such as added wow-factor for client interactions and passing along an easily shareable mini-demo to customers or the client’s stakeholders.</p>

<h3 id="better-work-is-motivated-by-meaning">12. Better work is motivated by <em>meaning</em></h3>

<div style="float:right;"><iframe width="300" height="168" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/u6XAPnuFjJc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>The final step of Pollack’s talk doesn’t really seem like a proper step to me. Maybe I zoned out, but Pollack didn’t connect the dots.</p>

<p>Perhaps he is suggesting that if you don’t think your work is meaningful, then you should find a new job, thereby increasing your productivity and output quality. In the end, Step 12 is still a good point. It will be familiar to any one who has seen <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc">this animated lecture</a> about motivation.</p>

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

<h1 id="what-i-thought">What I Thought</h1>
<p>This was a very solid event. I give it 8 hamster dances out of 10. Audience members were even given stickers and Code School coupons.</p>

<h2 id="presentation-content">Presentation Content</h2>
<p>I like Pollack’s style of discussing productivity problems in the context of “human nature.” The term “human nature” came up a lot, and whether or not it’s backed up by science, it certainly makes the presentation content feel more intuitive.</p>

<p>I’m also partial to Pollack’s claim that writing skills are a good way to differentiate yourself from other developers. He said that if two developers are applying for the same job, and they have similar hard skills, then one of the best ways to pick a new hire is to examine their writing because better writers are better communicators.</p>

<p>As you can tell from my re-interpretation of the 12 steps, I didn’t like some of Pollack’s wording, but I admit that I’m oddly particular about such things. I also didn’t like that some of the advice was just common sense. Maybe it’s unfair, but I tend to expect a lot of insight from advice-giving presentations so I feel let down when I’m presented with advice that is not only familiar, but derived from the same common sense I already possess.</p>

<h2 id="speaker">Speaker</h2>
<p>Pollack’s filler word is “right?” (with upward inflection). I find this to be a little annoying. It’s not the first time an otherwise awesome speaker has used “right?” this often. I think it bothers me because I perceive it to be slightly patronizing …or maybe a subtle form of pandering.</p>

<p>That said, I really like Pollack’s relatability. He seems to be a down-to-earth guy, making his speaking style easy to follow. Well done, Mr. Pollack.</p>

<h2 id="venue">Venue</h2>
<p>Chartboost had tons of free beer, great pizza (not just some Pizza Hut banality*), tons of free soft drinks, good mic setup for the speaker, and friendly staff on hand. After the presentation, they encouraged audience members to stick around and mingle, consume more pizza and beer, and use their company ping pong table. Sweet.</p>

<p>*Note: I’m not actually anti-Pizza Hut, and I’m certainly not a foodie, but even I found it refreshing to eat higher-quality pizza at a free meetup.</p>

<h1 id="followup">Followup</h1>
<p>I need to check out <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/jing.html">Jing</a>, a screencasting tool. It has limited recording time and no editing features. These limitations prevent you from spending too much time over-engineering your communique. It forces you to get to the point and be concise.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.moneyunder30.com/things-worth-spending-for-9101">This Money Under 30 article</a> recently appeared in my Facebook feed. One friend posted it; another friend left a beautifully/brutally succinct comment like so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This article is bad.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I concur, but I suck at being succint, so this here’s a giant explanation in the form of a blog post…</p>

<h1 id="is-my-sacasm-detector-working">Is My Sacasm Detector Working?</h1>

<p>The article is so random that it feels like satire at various points. The text is written with few facts  –mostly just vague thoughts. The author, Phil Villarreal, avoids specifics, and just encourages the misconception that you always get what you pay for. Value isn’t always directly tied to price. There are usually quite a few exceptions in the world of consumer goods.</p>

<p>What is considered too expensive/cheap? Other than that $80 exaggerated plate, we have no idea what price ranges he’s talking about. Also, his article assumes value always comes at a price. Is my sacrasm detector faulty, or is Mr. Villarreal being completely serious?</p>

<h1 id="systematic-breakdown">Systematic Breakdown</h1>

<p>Based on the article’s format, I’m going to split the rest of my blog post into two sections: 6 products/services with a tight value-cost relationship and 6 products/services where you may as well tap into their respective bargain bins.</p>

<p>I admit this blog post lacks citations, but at least I make some verifiable claims. Besides, I only need to provide anecdotal counter-examples to rebut Villarreal’s arguments thanks to his own reliance on anecdotes, hearsay, overgeneralizations, etc.</p>

<h2 id="allegedly-worth-spending-more">Allegedly Worth Spending More</h2>

<p><strong>Socks</strong> - Even expensive socks get holes in them. I’ve gotten expensive socks as gifts. They were thin and broke quickly. I’ve gotten generic-brand dress socks from Costco. In my 3+ years of wearing business pro and business casual attire on a daily basis, the cheap generics never broke, but the others did.</p>

<p><strong>Pillows</strong> - Yes, they’re important. No, you don’t need to pay extra to be happy with your choice of bedtime headrest. How many people do you know that have unnoteworthy pillows? How many of them are truly discontented?</p>

<p><strong>Toilet Paper</strong> - I would’ve agreed, but recently, I saw <a href="http://imgur.com/GN84qn1">this gem from Consumer Reports</a>: </p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/GN84qn1.jpg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/GN84qn1.jpg" alt="Toilet Paper comparo" /></a></p>

<p>So maybe I should reconsider my stance on toilet paper –now that’s a statement I never thought I’d share with the Internet.</p>

<p><strong>Computers</strong> - Most people don’t need expensive/fast computers, but if you’re going to spend the extra dough, you need to know what features you need. <strong>You don’t just throw more money at the store and assume you’ll get a product that performs better for your purposes.</strong> Most people will never notice the difference between an Intel Core i7 CPU (expensive) and a Core i3 (cheap). They <em>will</em> notice the difference between an SSD harddrive (expensive) and a conventional one (cheap). Too bad the Villarreal doesn’t provide these types of relevant details.</p>

<p><strong>Home Repairs</strong> - I agree, but how do I filter the <em>expensive good</em> from the <em>over-priced bad</em>. Advice please?</p>

<p><strong>Shoes</strong> - This is a perfect example of how the author needs to provide more context (i.e., PRICE RANGES). Yes, $20 Payless sneakers will die if you look at them too hard. But is he suggesting boycotting $40 Sketchers too? There is room for middle ground, but the article ignores that. Sure, Villarreal emphasizes comfort when it comes to shoes, but cheap shoes can be comfortable too.</p>

<p>By the way, if you’re buying shoes for a specific sport, I’d suggest that paying a lot generally isn’t worth it unless you’re really serious. For example, with the way I run on the court, I will wear out the tread of expensive tennis shoes just as quickly as I wear out the tread of mid-tier tennis shoes. I don’t think the $40-60 price difference is worth the added stiffness/support of a hardcore tennis shoe.</p>

<h2 id="allegedly-not-worth-spending-more">Allegedly NOT Worth Spending More</h2>

<p><strong>Shoelaces</strong> - Fair enough. Good analogy, Mr. Villarreal.</p>

<p><strong>Phones</strong> - I can understand saying the average Joe doesn’t need a top-of-the-line phone. However, expensive phones will generally be able to handle future OS updates better than cheaper ones, so it’s not always bad to get a flagship phone. Basically, if you’re a techie, you shouldn’t feel bad about your expensive phone purchase despite what Villarreal claims.</p>

<p>What’s dumb is buying a new phone too often –something the article mentions. What’s especially shameful is paying for a $100+/month phone bill just so you can do a lot of texting, occasional on-the-go Facebook, and take derivative photos…usually of food. If the phone user is on a family plan, then more power to them. If not, they better not complain about their bank account balance. [/off-topic]</p>

<p><strong>Haircuts</strong> - I mostly agree, but does he intend to speak for women as well?</p>

<p>And I don’t usually judge authors by their looks, but I’m not taking haircut advice from this guy. [I actually feel iffy about this burn. Too personal?] <strong><em>Regardless, “accept your mediocrity” is never good advice. This is the line that REALLY makes me think this article is satire. Am I being trolled?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Clothes</strong> - Let me get this straight. We should invest in quality socks, but not quality coats, dress clothes, gloves, pants, etc? WTF is this guy smoking? You don’t have to be an expert blogger like Villarreal to know that it’s worth investing in a solid jacket/coat, and that good jeans can last for a longggg time. (Yes, 4 ‘g’s because I’m talking about serious duration here)</p>

<p><strong>Car Repairs</strong> - Is the author color blind? Because the world sounds pretty black and white from his perspective. (Yes, I know color blind humans can generally see more than just B&amp;W) </p>

<p>Earlier, I made a case for saving money on things that wear out in my paragraph re:shoes, but now we’re talking about complicated beasts called cars. A higher-priced tire can have lots of benefits (less rolling resistance, less tire noise, much better grip, etc). The low-tier tires can have shitty grip. Mid-tier tires can have awesome grip, so I think they’re worth it. If Villarreal thinks shoes are crucial, he should also consider that tires are basically the shoes of cars. They’re considered the most crucial part all carowners can change.</p>

<p>More expensive motor oil can make a difference –especially conventional vs synthetic. Synthetic is a more expensive option even when you factor in its superior longevity (usually 5,000 miles between oil changes instead of 3,000), but it’s better for your engine and the environment (and the oil-based economy?) because you’re using up less oil and fewer resources during you car’s lifespan.</p>

<p>Lastly, more expensive brake pads generally have better stopping power. If you survive a near-accident and feel like doing something to allay your new-found fear, then you should consider spending some extra moolah to upgrade your tires and brakes.</p>

<p><strong>Food</strong> - $80 plates are not necessary? How insightful.</p>

<p>Maybe Villarreal could give some tips on how to buy healthy stuff at the grocery store without spending a lot? Otherwise, I will end up eating nothing other than ramen based on his two-extremes critical thinking skills.</p>

<p>Seriously though, everyone complains that eating healthy is expensive. Does he disagree? If so, he should explain because that would actually be useful.</p>

<h1 id="expound-is-the-apt-word">“Expound” is the Apt Word</h1>
<p>The article provides no specific suggestions for what brands/specs/details to buy/avoid (other than suggesting you make all judgements based on price tag), very few good examples, no context for what’s a good price range, etc. There is no true insight.</p>

<p>The article runs on weak reasoning, and the type of writing that tends to earn accusations of “lazy journalism.” It’s “lazy” because it uses an attractive, list-oriented headline/format to bait the reader into thinking a really efficient learning experience is presented within. Instead, the article reads like something an editor forced a blogger/journalist to write at the last minute to meet a quota. It’s filler.</p>

<p><strong>I admit I could be wrong about what is and isn’t worth splurging on, as I don’t have a ton of life experience. However, the style of Villarreal’s arguments leave so much room for questioning. <em>That’s what bothers me so much.</em></strong></p>

<p>You can’t present a case in such a manner without expecting someone to poke holes in it. For example, if I say, “The sky is blue due to the properties of light,” then I am technically correct, but I wouldn’t expect everyone to just accept that statement at its face value. I’d feel obligated to expound.</p>

<p>In my paragraph re:cars, I did a lot of explaining because I expect most people aren’t too familiar with cars’ intricacies. Ignorance is not stupidity. I assume most people are ignorant about a lot of car-related things, but I don’t assume them to be too stupid to understand some important, relevant details.</p>

<p>Villarreal fails to expound on the many statements that he should know aren’t worthy of acceptance based on face value alone. He should feel obligated to explain further, but he doesn’t because the article was never meant to truly help any one. It was just meant to get some easy page views.</p>

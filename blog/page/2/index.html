<p class="my-caption">Presenting my project, Co-Compare, to the folks of Hack Reactor</p>

<h1 id="life-update">Life Update</h1>

<p>I got a job! I will start using my JS skills for dolla bills on Monday. I will blog all about my rather tiring job search soon. For now, I will resume blogging about Hack Reactor from <a href="http://rebootjeff.github.io/blog/2013/10/28/hackr-diary-week-5/">where I left off</a>. During the 2nd half of the program, I didn’t do any blogging, but I took plenty of notes for the sake of blogging at a later time, so prepare to be amazed …or mildly amused. Remember, the following rollercoaster ride took place during late-October through mid-November.</p>

<h1 id="recap-of-events">Recap of Events</h1>

<h2 id="interim-week-different-format">Interim Week (different format)</h2>

<p>The 2nd half of Hack Reactor starts with an “interim week” (aka “solo week”) where expectations are a bit cloudy. <strong>The Hack Reactor website didn’t do a good job of explaining that the injection of an interim week means that Hack Reactor is really a 13-week program.</strong> During this special week, Hack Reactor HQ is not guaranteed to be open to students. Also, students are not guaranteed any access to staff. The staff is either taking a break or working on reconfiguring the offices or other changes.</p>

<p>In other words, the students are on their own for starting the first week of developing their personal projects. Students self-organize if they want to meet up at a cafe or whathaveyou to enable collaboration.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-did">What I Did</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I spent most of my time working from HR HQ when it was open. I used nearby cafes when it wasn’t.</li>
  <li>Like a few others, I used interim week to do some travelling and to catch up on sleep.</li>
  <li>At one point (maybe after interim week?), I broke my laptop by being a Linux noob. I was one of few Ubuntu users in my cohort, and I had trouble dealing with permission/access issues. I eventually followed some StackOverflow suggestion and fucked up my permissions so badly that I had to reinstall Ubuntu. As you can imagine, my emotions are still failing to heal from that self-inflicted disaster.
    <ul>
      <li>FYI, my new job is giving me a Mac. Soon I will join the majority of devs in the promise land of screens that actually reproduce accurate colors, impressive battery life, and installation wonders such as homebrew.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="extras">Extras</h2>

<ul>
  <li>In my cohort, we organized a night to go to a movie theater for Ender’s Game. Good times.</li>
  <li>A rep from <a href="http://famo.us/">Famous</a> stopped by to give a presentation about a brand new web app framework. It’s so new that even now, Famous is in beta. Back during the personal project period, it was in a closed beta (or was it alpha?), but Famous was inviting Hack Reactor students to access it! The framework renders special <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements in a breathtaking way. I never used it, but I will talk about it a bit more in another blog post.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h1>

<p>Holy. Crap. I learned so much during the personal project weeks. Admittedly, I didn’t work extra long hours until the last week or so before the deadline. By then, I was working at least 80 hours per week. In the first couple of days, I realized there was so much I had to learn that it felt quite overwhelming, and I had a difficult time starting.</p>

<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>

<p>Obviously I would have to learn a lot of app concepts, engineer some solid logic, etc. But I also had to do all this while learning new tools.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Balsamiq:</strong> Wireframing software. Creating wireframes really helps when trying to explain what you hope to build. To practice communication skills and project management, students had to explain their progress/goals very briefly during small stand-up meetings.</li>
  <li><strong>Yeoman:</strong> Boilerplate/scaffold generator. I used an Angular-Express generator to help me get started making a full-stack app with boilerplate code for Angular, Node, and Express. This served as a great “starter pack” of code.</li>
  <li><strong>Grunt:</strong> Task runner. To be honest, I used Grunt simpy because it came with Yeoman. However, gaining exposure to the tool opened my eyes to the possibilities provided by task runners like Grunt.</li>
  <li><strong>Stylus:</strong> CSS pre-processor. I’m not sure if CSS pre-processors are part of the tech stack or “just” another set of dev tools, but for what it’s worth, I didn’t write pure CSS for Co-Compare. Instead, I wrote Stylus CSS. I like the visual design side of front-end development, and using Stylus made that facet even more fun.</li>
  <li><strong>Heroku:</strong> Web app hosting provider. It’s easy to use because it follows a git workflow, but deployment still has challenges (re: environment configuration).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-tortured-ok-not-really-birth-of-an-idea">The Tortured (ok not really) Birth of An Idea</h2>

<p>I like to think my mind is superior –errr…I mean <em>creative</em>. However, it can be tough to come up with web app ideas based on constraints. Everyone worried about whether or not they could actually implement their ideas in just a few weeks (I think it amounted to only 2.5 weeks). In the end, I learned that “Just Do It” really applies. You can spend roughly 3 gajillion hours analyzing ideas, use cases, market needs, tech stacks, visual design, etc. But at some point, you need to just do it already. Just make something and see what happens. The price of failure is time spent. The gain of failure is lessons learned. A beauty of programming is the ability to quickly change, pivot, redo, etc.</p>

<h3 id="from-cool-to-meh">From Cool to Meh</h3>

<p>Originally, I thought my idea was too boring. I wanted to create a fantasy sports game specifically for tennis, but I couldn’t find a good way to get the data/stats from pro tennis matches, so I switched to something far less cool.</p>

<p>I switched to an idea spawned by my love for analyzing/comparing products and services. In the past, I’ve spent far too much time comparing video game consoles, cars, computer parts, <em>bootcamps</em>, etc. I enjoyed it too. A lot. But I knew most people aren’t crazy in this way, so I worried that my app idea for <a href="http://cocompare.herokuapp.com">Co-Compare</a> (a web app to build comparison tables and have others vote on them) was too unsexy.</p>

<h3 id="from-meh-to-oooh">From Meh to Oooh</h3>

<p>It’s true that Co-Compare doesn’t have a ton of wow-factor, but it provided plenty of opportunity:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> It was the type of idea that could work with very few features (good for rapid prototyping).</li>
  <li><strong>Exploration:</strong> But I could have fun adding more and more features as I desired. There were plenty of sub-ideas to explore and keep my brain satiated with more goodies to engineer.</li>
  <li><strong>Fundamentals:</strong> My app requires CRUD actions. Create, Read, Update, and Delete are fundamental app actions that devs should know. It’s weird to “brag” that Co-Compare helped me learn <em>fundamentals</em>, but it’s important, and it’s not easy just because it’s “fundamental.” Engineering a CRUDy app is a great learning experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Full-Stack:</strong> My app covered a lot of territory so it exposed me to CSS pre-processors, front-end MVC, API design, databases, user authentication, etc. This was really scary at first, but afterwards, I was truly proud of what I covered.</li>
</ul>

<p>I really believe that the full-stack nature of Co-Compare solidified my abilities as a web app developer. By creating a nice-looking front-end, my own API, and back-end models for a SQL datastore, I learned so much that it gave my confidence a tremendous boost –which is funny because I had a ton of confidence going into the personal project weeks…then I lost a lot of confidence when nothing I created worked the first time. So at the end, I regained a lot of confidence that I already had at the beginning.</p>

<p>Note: Some of my classmates implemented ideas that had very bare front ends because all the impressive stuff was run on the server side. Other folks created apps that had little or no back-end logic. The number of things wrong with these paths is quite small. In fact, most experts would say the number rhymes with “hero.” Anyway, my point is that this particular “full-stack” facet of my experience is not the “best” way, but just something that I really value for myself.</p>

<h2 id="dev-cycleprocess">Dev Cycle/Process</h2>

<p>Hack Reactor staff helped students with their projects by giving recommendations on tech stack decisions, dev tools, deployment options, etc. And of course, they gave us debugging help, but there was no hand holding.</p>

<p>The primary form of guidance came in the form of some project management structure. We formed small groups that held its members accountable for short-term goals. The staff taught us about iterative development and the concept of creating MVPs (minimal viable products) as milestones rather than aiming for creating versions that were 100% complete.</p>

<p>In other words, I learned about some dev processes to help promote productivity as a software engineer.</p>

<h1 id="want-to-learn-from-my-app">Want to Learn from My App?</h1>

<p>You can find the code for Co-Compare on my GitHub. I took the time to write up a decent README too because for some reason, I have a good time writing English in addition to JavaScript. I suggest you <a href="https://github.com/RebootJeff/co-compare#development">check this out</a> if you’re interested in learning more about how I created an app from scratch.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that you shouldn’t follow everything I do. For example, my Angular app folder structure neglects best practice. It was a popular structure at the time, but it’s actually best to name folders based on features, rather than just lumping all controllers together, all views together, etc.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/20140127/phonegap-android.png" alt="PhoneGap and Android have wonderful conversations" /></p>

<p>PhoneGap is a crazy tool for building “hybrid” smartphone apps. You write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for PhoneGap to compile into an app for iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Blackberry, etc. The app will simply use a browser embedded in a native app wrapper (hence, the “hybrid” label).</p>

<p>There are many pros and cons to developing with PhoneGap, but I won’t review those because you can find debates on the usefulness of PhoneGap and others like it so long as you have (at least) mediocre Google Fu. You do have Google Fu, <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=google+fu">right</a>? Don’t forget that Adobe PhoneGap is oftentimes referred to as Apache Cordova (even in modern documentation).</p>

<p>Anyway, this blog post is meant to disclose the growing pains you could encounter upon trying PhoneGap for the first time for Android development. Although if you’re developing for iOS, you’ll still face annoyances like having to disable WebView bounce (why doesn’t PhoneGap do that for you by default?!).</p>

<p>There were many unspoken hoops I had to jump through to get it working for me when I worked on an <a href="https://github.com/RebootJeff/phone-tag-phonegap">outdoor video game app</a>. I really wish someone had warned me about these hoops, but my loss is your gain.</p>

<h1 id="installfest">Installfest</h1>

<p>I’m sure you were told to just install the Android SDK plus PhoneGap and then you’d be off to the races, right? <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/4clw90A">WRONG</a>. So wrong. Incredibly wrong. Maybe it’s because my personal dev machine is running Ubuntu, but I had to install many missing pieces to the PhoneGap puzzle. Some PhoneGap tutorials cover some of these dev components, but I don’t remember seeing one that covered all of them so here you go:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Apache Ant: Java library/tool</li>
  <li>JRE: Java Runtime Environment</li>
  <li>JDK: Java Development Kit</li>
  <li>Android SDK: platform Software Dev Kit (make sure it comes with Eclipse)</li>
</ul>

<p>After you install the Android SDK, you probably want to make sure you have the right API version. I used API 17 for supporting phones with Android v4.2. Use the SDK manager to install the desired API. Type <code>android</code> in a terminal to open the SDK manager. If that doesn’t work, it’s probably because you have a problem that will be solved by reading the next section of this blog post.</p>

<h1 id="command-line-goodness">Command Line Goodness</h1>

<p>Everyone wants to use command line tools. In fact, PhoneGap wants to use some commands for Android development, but SURPRISE! Those commands are not available until you manually edit your .bash_profile file. You may have to do some searching to find where your .bash_profile sleeps at night, but mine was in my home directory (aka ~/.bash_profile). Keep in mind that it is a hidden file, so you need to enable viewing hidden files (in case you didn’t know). I created a Development folder for my Android dev tools. Then I added the following lines to my .bash_profile (make sure you replace my filepath with your filepath):</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption class="code-header" style="margin-bottom:-5px;"><span>.bash_profile </span></figcaption>
 <div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
# Adds Android SDK tools to command line
export PATH=$PATH:/home/myUserName/Development/adt-bundle-linux-x86_64-20131030/sdk/tools
export PATH=$PATH:/home/myUserName/Development/adt-bundle-linux-x86_64-20131030/sdk/platform-tools
</pre></div>
</div>
 </figure></notextile></div>

<p>Now, you’re finally set to begin development with PhoneGap. However, if you want certain features to work, you may have to modify some XML files. Read on, my relative from a common-and-super-old ancestor.</p>

<h1 id="xml-file-modifications">XML File Modifications</h1>

<p>Want your app to access external networks? Getting origin errors? Try the sweet taste of the <code>&lt;access origin&gt;</code> tag. Want to enable geolocation? Try the soothing sounds eminating from the <code>&lt;feature&gt;</code> tag. These tags need to be edited/added to the <code>config.xml</code> file of your PhoneGap project. Put your Google Fu to practice if you need more details. Just keep in mind that if you run into various problems in the future, the <code>config.xml</code> file is yet another possible source of irritation to debug.</p>

<p>Here’s a snippet from my config file:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption class="code-header" style="margin-bottom:-5px;"><span>config.xml </span></figcaption>
 <div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
# Adds Android SDK tools to command line
<span class="tag">&lt;access</span> <span class="attribute-name">origin</span>=<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">http://yourserver.com</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span><span class="tag">&gt;</span>
<span class="tag">&lt;feature</span> <span class="attribute-name">name</span>=<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">http://api.phonegap.com/1.0/geolocation</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span> <span class="tag">/&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
 </figure></notextile></div>

<p>By the way, it’s best practice to declare what kind of voodoo your app is utilizing. In case of GPS usage, modify your <code>/platforms/android/AndroidManifest.xml</code> file as follows:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption class="code-header" style="margin-bottom:-5px;"><span>/platforms/android/AndroidManifest.xml </span></figcaption>
 <div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
<span class="tag">&lt;uses-permission</span> <span class="attribute-name">android:name</span>=<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span> <span class="tag">/&gt;</span>
<span class="tag">&lt;uses-permission</span> <span class="attribute-name">android:name</span>=<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span> <span class="tag">/&gt;</span>
<span class="tag">&lt;uses-permission</span> <span class="attribute-name">android:name</span>=<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">android.permission.ACCESS_LOCATION_EXTRA_COMMANDS</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span> <span class="tag">/&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
 </figure></notextile></div>

<h1 id="down-the-rabbit-hole">Down the Rabbit Hole</h1>

<p>Using PhoneGap for the first time can be incredibly frustrating. I ran into so many small issues when learning how to use it. There can be problems with connecting a device to your computer, enabling certain phone features, dealing with compatibility quirks, etc.</p>

<h2 id="connecting-an-android-device">Connecting an Android Device</h2>
<p>Type <code>adb devices</code> into a terminal after you use a USB cable to attach an Android phone to your computer. Make sure that the phone is put into <strong>USB Debugging mode</strong>. You can find that mode in the developer options. Different versions of Android have different ways to access the developer options.</p>

<p>If you don’t see any devices listed, you may need to investigate drivers for your phone. Sometimes there are other problems with adb that can be solved be restarting: try typing <code>adb kill-server &amp;&amp; adb start-server</code> in your terminal (possibly with <code>sudo</code>).</p>

<h2 id="plugins-not-included">Plugins Not Included</h2>
<p>When using GPS, I ran into some blog posts claiming that it’s necessary to install a geolocation plugin. In my experience, it’s not needed, but for other features, it may be a different story. If you’re trying to access a hardware sensor or simply want to use a feature someone has already implemented (e.g., bar code scanner), then you may need to investigate plugins. This might be helpful: <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/news/2013/10/21/cordova-registry.html">About Cordova plugin registry</a></p>

<h2 id="android-fragmentation-strikes-again">Android Fragmentation Strikes Again</h2>
<p>Be warned: PhoneGap has different bugs for different versions of Android. For example, the PhoneGap app I worked on was built with Android API 17 (aka 4.2 aka Jelly Bean). I tested the app on a phone that uses Android 4.2.2 and a second phone that uses Android 4.4 (aka KitKat). The Jelly Bean phone had no functional issues with the app, but some CSS rules weren’t being applied correctly, which created some off-center layouts. The KitKat phone had no CSS issues, so it looked nice, but it had some functional issues regarding touch gestures. However, that could’ve been a problem with <a href="http://eightmedia.github.io/hammer.js/">Hammer.js</a>.</p>

<p>FYI, my team also encountered a problem in Android 4.4 and iOS 7 where scrolling wasn’t available for a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> that had overflowing text. We tried the usual CSS rules, but to no avail.</p>

<h1 id="links-links">Links? Links!</h1>

<h1 id="to-phonegap-or-not-to-phonegap">To PhoneGap or Not to PhoneGap</h1>

<p>So is PhoneGap worth the trouble? This blog post probably makes it sound like there’s a lot of shit to scoop before uncovering any treasure. That’s…mostly true. If rapid development is a priority, then PhoneGap is still a solid choice when you lack Objective-C and Java experience. I’ve heard from colleagues that learning Objective-C is its own special kind of hell, so that’s a +1 for PhoneGap, I guess.</p>

<p>To me, tech enthusiasts need to look at the bigger picture: imagine a world where mobile web apps dominate rather than having native apps dominate the smartphone landscape. Firefox OS is actually trying to embrace JavaScript, but why does it matter? Consider the differences in distribution. Forget app marketplaces. Forget Apple acting as a gatekeeper for iOS apps. Imagine that your app is as available as any other website. Web apps are becoming more and more powerful. There are new frameworks (e.g., <a href="http://famo.us/">Famous</a> and another brand new one that I can’t remember at the moment) that make it possible to replicate the oohlala of the much-lauded Yahoo! Weather native app.</p>

<p>The problem is that web apps for mobile devices can’t yet access native notifications. This is a huge obstacle for mobile web app dominance. Companies want their apps to have notifications to enhance user engagement and fight churn. Users want their apps to have notifications because it makes smartphones more helpful (although the line between helpful and spammy seems slimmer than my chances of becoming a guitar master). That said, web apps are getting better at using phones’ GPS sensors, cameras, accelerometers, etc. Hopefully the barrier between native app and mobile web app will continue to whither and eventually die like smallpox. In the words of unoriginal coaches every where, “WE CAN DO IT!”</p>

<p>When an employer/recruiter asks you this question, you should answer, “YES OF COURSE I DO.” Then you casually bombard them with the questions listed below.

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my <a href="/blog/2013/12/26/queues-and-stacks-in-javascript/">previous post</a>, I began my quest to help noob programmers by introducing the basic computer science topic of data structures. I provided a quick overview of queues and stacks, so please read all about ‘em before engaging your eyeballs with this blog post. This time around, we’ll check out four different patterns for creating classes in JavaScript while learning how to build stacks and queues from scratch.</p>

<p>Before we go, I should warn you that I’m going to focus on describing the class instantiation patterns rather than thoroughly explaining the implementation of the data structures. Just keep in mind that we are going to explore building stacks and queues with objects rather than arrays. More specifically, we will use a property called <code>storage</code> that is an object, not an array. Now I know what you’re pondering.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is a beautiful question. Please ask it all the time (but please don’t troll me by leaving “Why?” in the comments section of this blog post). In this case, the answer to “Why?” may be a tad disatisfying. The answer is “because we can”, but don’t worry! It’ll be fun. Now, let’s start instantiating some motherhugging classes.</p>

<h1 id="functional-instantiation">1. Functional Instantiation</h1>

<p>The simplest way to implement classes is with a “maker” function that creates a new instance of the class and returns that instance so it can be stored as a variable. The new instance is just like any other JavaScript object. It can have properties that store relevant information about the instance (e.g., with a <code>Car</code> class, instances might have a <code>price</code> property). It can also have properties that store functions. These functions serve as <strong>methods</strong> that are tightly associated with the instance.</p>

<h4 id="characteristics">Characteristics</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Creates new copies of the same functions when creating a new instance of the same class. This lack of reuse takes up more memory and can leave an unsavory taste in some programmers’ mouths.</li>
  <li>There is no quick way to modify all instances of the class after they’ve been created. This will become more clear after examining the other instantiation tactics.</li>
  <li>Private variables can be created/used by harnessing <strong>closure scope</strong> superpowers, but I won’t get into that today.</li>
  <li>If you understand JavaScript functions and objects, then you can understand classes implemented via functional instantiation (other instantiation techniques require knowledge of <code>this</code> and/or <code>new</code>).</li>
  <li>Could be used to create callable instances (i.e., the class could return a function rather than an object filled with properties).</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="functional-instantiation-wshared-methods">2. Functional Instantiation w/Shared Methods</h1>

<p>By utilizing an object filled with methods, several classes can be created that have the same methods without creating new copies of said methods. The classes will use their own function references to refer to the same set of shared methods. Therefore, using shared methods eats up less memory than functional instantiation <em>without</em> shared methods.</p>

<h4 id="characteristics-1">Characteristics</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Reuses functions (which conserves memory) by getting function references from a utility such as <a href="http://underscorejs.org/#extend">Underscore.js</a>’s <code>_.extend(instance,methods)</code>.</li>
  <li>Retains the same benefits as functional instantiation <em>without</em> shared methods.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="prototypal-instantiation">3. Prototypal Instantiation</h1>

<p>The key to prototypal instantiation is the use of <code>Object.create()</code> to utilize shared methods. Unlike functional instantiation with shared methods, there is no need to use an <code>extend()</code> function.</p>

<p>While it’s possible to use a prototype’s functions with <code>Object.create(ExampleClass.prototype);</code>, it’s also possible to (ironically) avoid the word “prototype” altogether by using <code>Object.create(sharedMethods);</code>.</p>

<h4 id="characteristics-2">Characteristics</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Reuses shared functions via <code>Object.create(Example.prototype)</code> or <code>Object.create(objectOfFunctions)</code>.</li>
  <li>Unlike functional instantiation, function references are shared. Each instance of the class does not get its own function references that point to the shared methods. This saves even more memory (although it is a very small improvement).</li>
  <li>Unlike functional instantiation, there is no way to use closure scope to enforce privacy of variables.</li>
  <li>Variables are stored on the returned object (aka <code>instance</code>), which means the shared stack methods need to use the keyword <code>this</code> to access the necessary data. It’s not a huge bummer, but if you’re a beginner, then <code>this</code> can be a confusing concept.</li>
  <li>Can use prototype chains for dynamic method modification and inheritance (subclasses!).</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="pseudoclassical-instantiation">4. Pseudoclassical Instantiation</h1>

<p>This is the most commonly used class pattern. It’s also the most complicated because, in addition to using the <code>this</code> keyword, it involves two concepts that the other class patterns don’t require: the <code>new</code> keyword and prototypes. Prototypal instantiation uses prototypes via <code>Object.create()</code>, but pseudoclassical instantiation needs you to explicitly type out <code>ClassName.prototype.methodName</code>, which is just another source of confusion for beginners.</p>

<p>Also, it’s the only class pattern that uses a true <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructor_(object-oriented_programming)">constructor</a> for creating new instances. Other class patterns use instantiator functions that explicitly return a new instance. The pseudoclassical class pattern does not perform such a return thanks to the <code>new</code> keyword.</p>

<h4 id="characteristics-3">Characteristics</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Uses prototype chains to provide methods to instances of a class.</li>
  <li>Allows for dynamic method modification and inheritance (subclasses!) via prototype chains.</li>
  <li>Refers to the instance that’s being created with the <code>this</code> keyword.</li>
  <li>Needs the <code>new</code> keyword to make an instance of a class.</li>
  <li>Has a true constructor that is named with a noun rather than a verb. The name is capitalized.</li>
  <li>Is the most commonly used class pattern.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The proverbial “they” say (says?) it’s good to write technical blog posts. Blog posts that get down and dirty with the nitty gritty of low-level, in-the-weeds details and nuances accompanied by jargon, acronyms, and name-dropping are all the rage in the dev community. More importantly, I really want to help beginners learn programming, so I may as well teach some basic concepts via my blog. (Later on, I hope to contribute more to <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>, which is a free, open-source, online resource for beginners created by a very cool individual.)</p>

<p>So as my first foray in technical blog posts, I present to all loveable noobs: the introductory data structures known as stacks and queues.</p>

<h1 id="whats-a-stack">What’s a Stack?</h1>

<p>A stack is a collection of items (or data) that follow a particular rule: the last item to join the collection is the first one to leave.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <strong>L</strong>ast data <strong>I</strong>n is the <strong>F</strong>irst data <strong>O</strong>ut (<strong>LIFO</strong>)</li>
  <li>Add data: <strong>push</strong></li>
  <li>Remove data: <strong>pop</strong></li>
  <li>Data enters and exits at the same end of the stack (at the <strong>top</strong>)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="simple-implementation">Simple implementation</h2>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption class="code-header" style="margin-bottom:-5px;"><span>Simple Stack (array-based example)</span><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1590247/how-do-you-implement-a-stack-and-a-queue-in-javascript">Stack Overflow </a></figcaption> <div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
<span class="keyword">var</span> stack = [];
stack.push(<span class="integer">1</span>);  <span class="comment">// use the push method provided by the Array prototype</span>
stack.push(<span class="integer">2</span>);
stack.push(<span class="integer">3</span>);
console.log(stack);  <span class="comment">// output: [1,2,3]</span>

<span class="keyword">var</span> popped = stack.pop();  <span class="comment">// use the pop method provided by the Array prototype</span>
console.log(popped);  <span class="comment">// output: 3</span>
console.log(stack);  <span class="comment">// output: [1,2]</span>
</pre></div>

<h2 id="ridiculous-analogy">Ridiculous analogy</h2>

<p>Imagine you’ve found an old, abandoned well. You think to yourself, “Bruce Wayne fell down a well when he was a kid, and I wanna be just like the Batman, so I’m gonna fall down this sweet well!” But you hesitate because …it’s a well, and wells are scary, ya know?</p>

<p>Unbeknownst to you, <a href="http://batman.wikia.com/wiki/Harley_Quinn">your arch-nemesis</a> is out walking her <a href="http://batman.wikia.com/wiki/Bud_and_Lou">pet hyenas</a>. She spots you, and quickly runs over to shove you into the well. She giggles in delight at the sight of your plight. She then hides and waits for more people to walk near the well so she can <strong>push</strong> them too.</p>

<p>It just so happens that this well has the diameter of a single person’s width. When someone is pushed into the well, they land on top of the last person who fell in before them. This creates a <strong>stack</strong> of people and some rather pronounced discomfort. Eventually, there are 5 people in this deep-yet-thin well, and you decide it’s time to call for help to get rescued.</p>

<p>To your disappointment, the not-so-dark knight named Superman arrives to pull you well-dwellers out (one at a time). The last one pushed into the well is the first to <strong>pop</strong> out. <em>LIFO.</em></p>

<h1 id="whats-a-queue">What’s a Queue?</h1>

<p>A queue is a collection of items (or data) that follow the real-life “rules” of waiting in a line of people: the first item to join the collection is the first one to leave the collection.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <strong>F</strong>irst data <strong>I</strong>n is the <strong>F</strong>irst data <strong>O</strong>ut (<strong>FIFO</strong>)</li>
  <li>Add data: <strong>enqueue</strong></li>
  <li>Remove data: <strong>dequeue</strong></li>
  <li>Data exits at the: <strong>head</strong> of the queue</li>
  <li>Data enters at the: <strong>tail</strong> of the queue</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="simple-implementation-1">Simple implementation</h2>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption class="code-header" style="margin-bottom:-5px;"><span>Simple Queue (array-based example)</span><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1590247/how-do-you-implement-a-stack-and-a-queue-in-javascript">Stack Overflow </a></figcaption> <div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
<span class="keyword">var</span> queue = [];
queue.push(<span class="integer">1</span>);  <span class="comment">// &quot;enqueue&quot;</span>
queue.push(<span class="integer">2</span>);
queue.push(<span class="integer">3</span>);
console.log(queue);  <span class="comment">// output: [1,2,3]</span>

<span class="keyword">var</span> dequeued = queue.shift();  <span class="comment">// &quot;dequeue&quot;</span>
console.log(dequeued);  <span class="comment">// output: 1</span>
console.log(queue);  <span class="comment">// output: [2,3]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
 </figure></notextile></div>

<h2 id="ridiculous-analogy-1">Ridiculous analogy</h2>

<p>Batman decides to do some in-the-field combat training. He drops into the middle of a gang meeting and yells, “I’ve sent your buddies to jail. I know you want revenge. Catch me if you can. P.S. I’m Batman!” Why does the cowled hero do this? We all know Batman is a smart dude, and sure enough, he has a clever plan. He lures the baddies who are running after him into a narrow alley.</p>

<p>The gangsters can only approach Batman one at a time to fit in the narrow alley, so they form a line (aka <strong>queue</strong>). The gangster at the front of the line is the first gangster knocked out (aka <strong>dequeued</strong>) by Batman (<strong>first in; first out</strong>). You might even say that Batman’s fists aim for the <strong>head</strong> of the queue and foolish gangsters enter at the <strong>tail</strong> of the line of doom.</p>

<h1 id="the-story-will-continue">The Story Will Continue</h1>

<p>Stay tuned for more blog posts on data structures. My next technical blog post will examine how to implement stacks and queues from scratch (without arrays) to get a deeper understanding of push, pop, enqueue, and dequeue. I know you can’t wait for the moment I deliver on this promise. I can hear your panting through my WiFi, but please stay patient. I was busy working on a <a href="https://github.com/RebootJeff/cocompare">web app</a> and then a <a href="https://github.com/RebootJeff/phone-tag-phonegap">mobile app</a>. Now, I’m busy with job searching while possibly starting mini-project.</p>

<p>On a mildly amusing, unrelated note: isn’t it funny to think about the phrase “stay tuned”? It’s getting rather archaic now that terrestrial, over-the-air TV and radio are losing popularity. Yes, these are the random things I think about as I write blog posts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My previous blog post was nearly 3 weeks ago. Why? What’s stopped me from posting more stories of life at Hack Reactor? For the past several days, I have been working on an individual project. I was very confident going into it, and I should eventually blog specifically about the initial stages, but as it turned out …there is a crap-ton of stuff to juggle when developing a web app. There are so many things that can go wrong in your workflow –not just in your code.</p>

<h1 id="things-that-kept-me-busy">Things That Kept me Busy</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Defaut installation of node/npm on Ubuntu led to file permissions issues. Oh shit.</li>
  <li>Figuring out Yeoman: Before <code>npm install -g yo</code>: I wonder what will happen. After <code>yo generator-angularexpress</code>: What is all this stuff?! Oh nice.</li>
  <li>Figuring out Grunt: How can I get it to work with Stylus? Oh nice.</li>
  <li>Easy, but time-consuming (to make sure you don’t break something that used to work)
    <ul>
      <li>Organizing files/folders in a professional way (inter-file <code>require</code> statements can break)</li>
      <li>Using environment variables (typos can be devastating)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Facebook Authorization
    <ul>
      <li>Making 2 FB apps (one for dev environment; one for production environment)</li>
      <li>Figuring out the proper callback URL</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Databases
    <ul>
      <li>Juggling MySQL in development environment, then switching to PostgreSQL in production.</li>
      <li>Why is the production database getting flooded? Oh there’s a random configuration setting I missed in Sequelize.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Random Heroku hiccups (at one point, a node module provider went down, causing Heroku’s <code>npm install</code> to die).</li>
</ul>

<p>These are just a few of the little obstacles that add up. You don’t see them coming. They take quite a bit of time to hunt down.</p>

<h1 id="nerdy-chuck-norris-jokes">Nerdy Chuck Norris Jokes</h1>

<p>As an apology for not blogging much in the past 3 weeks, here are some jokes from <strong><a href="http://www.icndb.com/">the best API ever</a></strong>:</p>

<p>All arrays Chuck Norris declares are of infinite size, because Chuck Norris knows no bounds.</p>

<p>Chuck Norris doesn’t have disk latency because the hard drive knows to hurry the hell up.</p>

<p>Chuck Norris can’t test for equality because he has no equal.</p>

<p>Chuck Norris burst the dot com bubble.</p>

<p>All browsers support the hex definitions #chuck and #norris for the colors black and blue.</p>

<p>MySpace actually isn’t your space, it’s Chuck’s (he just lets you use it).</p>

<p>Chuck Norris can solve the Towers of Hanoi in one move.</p>

<p>Chuck Norris finished World of Warcraft.</p>

<p>Chuck Norris doesn’t use web standards as the web will conform to him.</p>

<p>Whiteboards are white because Chuck Norris scared them that way.</p>

<p>Chuck Norris can delete the Recycling Bin.</p>

<p>Chuck Norris’s beard can type 140 wpm.</p>

<p>Chuck Norris can unit test entire applications with a single assert.</p>

<p>Chuck Norris doesn’t need sudo, he just types “Chuck Norris” before his commands.</p>

<p>Chuck Norris doesn’t need a debugger, he just stares down the code until the bug confesses.</p>

<p>The class object inherits from Chuck Norris</p>

<p>Chuck Norris knows the last digit of PI.</p>

<p>Chuck Norris’ Internet connection is faster upstream than downstream because even data has more incentive to run from him than to him.</p>

<p>Chuck Norris’s keyboard has the Any key.</p>

<p>Chuck Norris can install iTunes without installing Quicktime.</p>

<p>Chuck Norris’s OSI network model has only one layer - Physical.</p>

<p>Chuck Norris compresses his files by doing a flying round house kick to the hard drive.</p>

<p>Chuck Norris uses canvas in IE.</p>

<p>Chuck Norris’s database has only one table, ‘Kick’, which he DROPs frequently.</p>

<p>Chuck Norris’s brain waves are suspected to be harmful to cell phones.</p>

<p>Chuck Norris sits at the stand-up.</p>

<p>Chuck Norris has never registered an account. He just logs in.</p>

<p>Code runs faster when Chuck Norris glares at it.</p>

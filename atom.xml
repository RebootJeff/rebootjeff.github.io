    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.moneyunder30.com/things-worth-spending-for-9101">This Money Under 30 article</a> recently appeared in my Facebook feed. One friend posted it; another friend left a beautifully/brutally succinct comment like so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This article is bad.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I concur, but I suck at being succint, so this here’s a giant explanation in the form of a blog post…</p>

<h1 id="is-my-sacasm-detector-working">Is My Sacasm Detector Working?</h1>

<p>The article is so random that it feels like satire at various points. The text is written with few facts  –mostly just vague thoughts. The author, Phil Villarreal, avoids specifics, and just encourages the misconception that you always get what you pay for. Value isn’t always directly tied to price. There are usually quite a few exceptions in the world of consumer goods.</p>

<p>What is considered too expensive/cheap? Other than that $80 exaggerated plate, we have no idea what price ranges he’s talking about. Also, his article assumes value always comes at a price. Is my sacrasm detector faulty, or is Mr. Villarreal being completely serious?</p>

<h1 id="systematic-breakdown">Systematic Breakdown</h1>

<p>Based on the article’s format, I’m going to split the rest of my blog post into two sections: 6 products/services with a tight value-cost relationship and 6 products/services where you may as well tap into their respective bargain bins.</p>

<p>I admit this blog post lacks citations, but at least I make some verifiable claims. Besides, I only need to provide anecdotal counter-examples to rebut Villarreal’s arguments thanks to his own reliance on anecdotes, hearsay, overgeneralizations, etc.</p>

<h2 id="allegedly-worth-spending-more">Allegedly Worth Spending More</h2>

<p><strong>Socks</strong> - Even expensive socks get holes in them. I’ve gotten expensive socks as gifts. They were thin and broke quickly. I’ve gotten generic-brand dress socks from Costco. In my 3+ years of wearing business pro and business casual attire on a daily basis, the cheap generics never broke, but the others did.</p>

<p><strong>Pillows</strong> - Yes, they’re important. No, you don’t need to pay extra to be happy with your choice of bedtime headrest. How many people do you know that have unnoteworthy pillows? How many of them are truly discontented?</p>

<p><strong>Toilet Paper</strong> - I would’ve agreed, but recently, I saw <a href="http://imgur.com/GN84qn1">this gem from Consumer Reports</a>: </p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/GN84qn1.jpg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/GN84qn1.jpg" alt="Toilet Paper comparo" /></a></p>

<p>So maybe I should reconsider my stance on toilet paper –now that’s a statement I never thought I’d share with the Internet.</p>

<p><strong>Computers</strong> - Most people don’t need expensive/fast computers, but if you’re going to spend the extra dough, you need to know what features you need. <strong>You don’t just throw more money at the store and assume you’ll get a product that performs better for your purposes.</strong> Most people will never notice the difference between an Intel Core i7 CPU (expensive) and a Core i3 (cheap). They <em>will</em> notice the difference between an SSD harddrive (expensive) and a conventional one (cheap). Too bad the Villarreal doesn’t provide these types of relevant details.</p>

<p><strong>Home Repairs</strong> - I agree, but how do I filter the <em>expensive good</em> from the <em>over-priced bad</em>. Advice please?</p>

<p><strong>Shoes</strong> - This is a perfect example of how the author needs to provide more context (i.e., PRICE RANGES). Yes, $20 Payless sneakers will die if you look at them too hard. But is he suggesting boycotting $40 Sketchers too? There is room for middle ground, but the article ignores that. Sure, Villarreal emphasizes comfort when it comes to shoes, but cheap shoes can be comfortable too.</p>

<p>By the way, if you’re buying shoes for a specific sport, I’d suggest that paying a lot generally isn’t worth it unless you’re really serious. For example, with the way I run on the court, I will wear out the tread of expensive tennis shoes just as quickly as I wear out the tread of mid-tier tennis shoes. I don’t think the $40-60 price difference is worth the added stiffness/support of a hardcore tennis shoe.</p>

<h2 id="allegedly-not-worth-spending-more">Allegedly NOT Worth Spending More</h2>

<p><strong>Shoelaces</strong> - Fair enough. Good analogy, Mr. Villarreal.</p>

<p><strong>Phones</strong> - I can understand saying the average Joe doesn’t need a top-of-the-line phone. However, expensive phones will generally be able to handle future OS updates better than cheaper ones, so it’s not always bad to get a flagship phone. Basically, if you’re a techie, you shouldn’t feel bad about your expensive phone purchase despite what Villarreal claims.</p>

<p>What’s dumb is buying a new phone too often –something the article mentions. What’s especially shameful is paying for a $100+/month phone bill just so you can do a lot of texting, occasional on-the-go Facebook, and take derivative photos…usually of food. If the phone user is on a family plan, then more power to them. If not, they better not complain about their bank account balance. [/off-topic]</p>

<p><strong>Haircuts</strong> - I mostly agree, but does he intend to speak for women as well?</p>

<p>And I don’t usually judge authors by their looks, but I’m not taking haircut advice from this guy. [I actually feel iffy about this burn. Too personal?] <strong><em>Regardless, “accept your mediocrity” is never good advice. This is the line that REALLY makes me think this article is satire. Am I being trolled?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Clothes</strong> - Let me get this straight. We should invest in quality socks, but not quality coats, dress clothes, gloves, pants, etc? WTF is this guy smoking? You don’t have to be an expert blogger like Villarreal to know that it’s worth investing in a solid jacket/coat, and that good jeans can last for a longggg time. (Yes, 4 ‘g’s because I’m talking about serious duration here)</p>

<p><strong>Car Repairs</strong> - Is the author color blind? Because the world sounds pretty black and white from his perspective. (Yes, I know color blind humans can generally see more than just B&amp;W) </p>

<p>Earlier, I made a case for saving money on things that wear out in my paragraph re:shoes, but now we’re talking about complicated beasts called cars. A higher-priced tire can have lots of benefits (less rolling resistance, less tire noise, much better grip, etc). The low-tier tires can have shitty grip. Mid-tier tires can have awesome grip, so I think they’re worth it. If Villarreal thinks shoes are crucial, he should also consider that tires are basically the shoes of cars. They’re considered the most crucial part all carowners can change.</p>

<p>More expensive motor oil can make a difference –especially conventional vs synthetic. Synthetic is a more expensive option even when you factor in its superior longevity (usually 5,000 miles between oil changes instead of 3,000), but it’s better for your engine and the environment (and the oil-based economy?) because you’re using up less oil and fewer resources during you car’s lifespan.</p>

<p>Lastly, more expensive brake pads generally have better stopping power. If you survive a near-accident and feel like doing something to allay your new-found fear, then you should consider spending some extra moolah to upgrade your tires and brakes.</p>

<p><strong>Food</strong> - $80 plates are not necessary? How insightful.</p>

<p>Maybe Villarreal could give some tips on how to buy healthy stuff at the grocery store without spending a lot? Otherwise, I will end up eating nothing other than ramen based on his two-extremes critical thinking skills.</p>

<p>Seriously though, everyone complains that eating healthy is expensive. Does he disagree? If so, he should explain because that would actually be useful.</p>

<h1 id="expound-is-the-apt-word">“Expound” is the Apt Word</h1>
<p>The article provides no specific suggestions for what brands/specs/details to buy/avoid (other than suggesting you make all judgements based on price tag), very few good examples, no context for what’s a good price range, etc. There is no true insight.</p>

<p>The article runs on weak reasoning, and the type of writing that tends to earn accusations of “lazy journalism.” It’s “lazy” because it uses an attractive, list-oriented headline/format to bait the reader into thinking a really efficient learning experience is presented within. Instead, the article reads like something an editor forced a blogger/journalist to write at the last minute to meet a quota. It’s filler.</p>

<p><strong>I admit I could be wrong about what is and isn’t worth splurging on, as I don’t have a ton of life experience. However, the style of Villarreal’s arguments leave so much room for questioning. <em>That’s what bothers me so much.</em></strong></p>

<p>You can’t present a case in such a manner without expecting someone to poke holes in it. For example, if I say, “The sky is blue due to the properties of light,” then I am technically correct, but I wouldn’t expect everyone to just accept that statement at its face value. I’d feel obligated to expound.</p>

<p>In my paragraph re:cars, I did a lot of explaining because I expect most people aren’t too familiar with cars’ intricacies. Ignorance is not stupidity. I assume most people are ignorant about a lot of car-related things, but I don’t assume them to be too stupid to understand some important, relevant details.</p>

<p>Villarreal fails to expound on the many statements that he should know aren’t worthy of acceptance based on face value alone. He should feel obligated to explain further, but he doesn’t because the article was never meant to truly help any one. It was just meant to get some easy page views.</p>

    <link href="http://RebootJeff.github.io/blog/2013/08/15/auto-hr-after-h1/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-15T12:02:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://RebootJeff.github.io/blog/2013/08/15/auto-hr-after-h1</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wasn’t happy with the style of my standard <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> header. I wanted to spice things up. After some aimless browsing, I learned that there is an <code>:after</code> selector in CSS. Inspired by this new selector, I wanted to find a way to add an <code>&lt;hr/&gt;</code> element “after” my <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> headers. </p>

<h1 id="check-out-this-sweet-hr-man">Check Out This Sweet HR, Man</h1>

<p>Apparently, it doesn’t quite work the way I expected, but that’s ok because I eventually found <a href="http://css-tricks.com/examples/hrs/">this sweet compilation of horizontal rules</a>!</p>

<p>I entered the following CSS code into my <strong>sass/custom/_styles.scss</strong> file:</p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="class">.entry-content</span> <span class="type">h1</span> {
  <span class="key">text-align</span>: <span class="value">center</span>;
  <span class="key">margin-top</span>: <span class="float">12px</span>;
}
<span class="class">.entry-content</span> <span class="type">h1</span><span class="pseudo-class">:after</span> {
  <span class="key">content</span>: <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content"> </span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>;
  <span class="key">display</span>: <span class="value">block</span>;
  <span class="key">height</span>: <span class="float">1px</span>;
  <span class="key">margin</span>: <span class="float">6px</span> <span class="float">0px</span> <span class="float">6px</span> <span class="float">0px</span>;
  <span class="key">background-image</span>: <span class="error">-</span><span class="error">w</span><span class="error">e</span><span class="error">b</span><span class="error">k</span><span class="error">i</span><span class="error">t</span><span class="error">-</span><span class="error">l</span><span class="error">i</span><span class="error">n</span><span class="error">e</span><span class="error">a</span><span class="error">r</span><span class="error">-</span><span class="error">g</span><span class="error">r</span><span class="error">a</span><span class="error">d</span><span class="error">i</span><span class="error">e</span><span class="error">n</span><span class="error">t</span>(<span class="value">left</span>, <span class="color">rgba(0,0,0,0)</span>, <span class="color">rgba(0,0,0,0.75)</span>, <span class="color">rgba(0,0,0,0)</span>); 
  <span class="key">background-image</span>:    <span class="error">-</span><span class="error">m</span><span class="error">o</span><span class="error">z</span><span class="error">-</span><span class="error">l</span><span class="error">i</span><span class="error">n</span><span class="error">e</span><span class="error">a</span><span class="error">r</span><span class="error">-</span><span class="error">g</span><span class="error">r</span><span class="error">a</span><span class="error">d</span><span class="error">i</span><span class="error">e</span><span class="error">n</span><span class="error">t</span>(<span class="value">left</span>, <span class="color">rgba(0,0,0,0)</span>, <span class="color">rgba(0,0,0,0.75)</span>, <span class="color">rgba(0,0,0,0)</span>); 
  <span class="key">background-image</span>:     <span class="error">-</span><span class="error">m</span><span class="error">s</span><span class="error">-</span><span class="error">l</span><span class="error">i</span><span class="error">n</span><span class="error">e</span><span class="error">a</span><span class="error">r</span><span class="error">-</span><span class="error">g</span><span class="error">r</span><span class="error">a</span><span class="error">d</span><span class="error">i</span><span class="error">e</span><span class="error">n</span><span class="error">t</span>(<span class="value">left</span>, <span class="color">rgba(0,0,0,0)</span>, <span class="color">rgba(0,0,0,0.75)</span>, <span class="color">rgba(0,0,0,0)</span>); 
  <span class="key">background-image</span>:      <span class="error">-</span><span class="error">o</span><span class="error">-</span><span class="error">l</span><span class="error">i</span><span class="error">n</span><span class="error">e</span><span class="error">a</span><span class="error">r</span><span class="error">-</span><span class="error">g</span><span class="error">r</span><span class="error">a</span><span class="error">d</span><span class="error">i</span><span class="error">e</span><span class="error">n</span><span class="error">t</span>(<span class="value">left</span>, <span class="color">rgba(0,0,0,0)</span>, <span class="color">rgba(0,0,0,0.75)</span>, <span class="color">rgba(0,0,0,0)</span>); 
}
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So instead of adding <code>&lt;hr/&gt;</code>s after my <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>s, I added gradients inside of very thin background images. It’s more complicated than what I had originally envisioned, but it looks way nicer.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in the process of writing this blog post, I discovered that my codeblocks (powered by CodeRay) aren’t as responsive as I had hoped. I mentioned my CodeRay configuration in <a href="http://RebootJeff.github.io/blog/2013/08/02/ready-set-octopress/#update-aug-10-2013">my first post</a>. The configuration involves picking a codeblock format Octopress <strong>_config.yml</strong> file.</p>

<p>I chose <code>coderay_line_numbers: table</code> at first, because I want line numbers, and I want them to be separated from the code. The problem is that CodeRay codeblock tables are apparently unresponsive to browser size. Consequently, the codeblocks were wider than the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s that contained them whenever they were viewed on a smartphone or even on a PC looking at this blog’s front page. The front page automatically narrows my posts quite a bit, and that made the codeblock tables very unhappy. It was very annoying.</p>

<p>I haven’t found a true solution despite diving into the CSS. All the relevant CSS selectors already have <code>width: 100%</code> so I don’t know what else to do. I experimented with some <code>overflow</code> properties, but to no avail. For now, I have resorted to turning off line numbers entirely. Dammit.</p>

    <link href="http://RebootJeff.github.io/blog/2013/08/10/event-review-intro-to-ux-at-general-assembly/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-10T13:31:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://RebootJeff.github.io/blog/2013/08/10/event-review-intro-to-ux-at-general-assembly</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://RebootJeff.github.io/images/ga_logo_sp.jpg" alt="General Assembly logo" /></p>

<p>Last Thursday, <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a> hosted a presentation by <a href="http://bluelikeanorange.net">Jenny Tsai</a> (nice URL, by the way). Tsai is a pro UX designer, but her talk was meant for UX noobs. So instead of focusing on <em>how</em> to be a great UX designer, <strong>she focused on <em>what</em> is a UX designer.</strong> I’m not looking to become a UX designer, but the event was free, and I like hearing about the various roles involved in modern tech startups. Besides, I think all wannabe web developers such as myself wonder what differences separate UX design and web development.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I was a fool, so I didn’t bring a laptop or padfolio for taking notes, so I’m just going to relay the short bits I jotted down in my smartphone.</p>

<h1 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h1>
<p>Note: Tsai didn’t present this info in a DOs vs DON’Ts fashion. She didn’t do a “What’s the deal with wireframes” slide. I’m presenting the info my way, not her way.</p>

<h2 id="general">General</h2>
<p><strong>What is UX design?</strong> Designer is to developer as architect is to engineer.</p>

<p><strong>What do UX designers do on any given day?</strong> Draw wireframes and mockups, draft user personas, create task flows, and get user input.</p>

<p><strong>What’s the deal with “wireframes” and “pixel perfect mockups”?</strong> Wireframe is to mockup as sketch is to painting. It’s all about fidelity. Both are generally non-functional, but sometimes functional mockups are created just to demonstrate animations, screen changes, and general navigation. You want to use wireframes for quickly iterating on an idea. You should save mockups for later because they use a lot of time, which is equivalent to money. And I hear money is expensive these days.</p>

<p><strong>What are user personas?</strong> Looks more like a marketing thing to me, but it’s basically creating profiles of target demographics. For I’mPregnantNowWhat.com, a user persona is going to be a profile of a young woman whose tech savviness is at level X. She cares about A, B, and C. And so on. I zoned out for a bit here, so I could be wrong.</p>

<p><strong>What are task flows?</strong> Flow charts on how users interact with the website/app.</p>

<p><strong>Who do UX designers interact with on a daily basis?</strong> Product managers, marketing peeps, customer service folks, developers, and other designers. PMs have the vision, marketing cares about the branding, customer service gives you customer feedback, and developers are the engineering for your architecting.</p>

<p><strong>What is information architecture?</strong> Figuring out how relevant info is organized. For example, a shopping website could display products based on price, color, size, etc. For example, with Amazon.com, IA also involves deciding what product categories/options are displayed to the user so they can browse based on those categories/options. I imagine this is where the battle between overwhelming a user with too many choices and underwhelming the user with not enough info unfolds.</p>

<p><strong>What software is used by UX designers?</strong> Wireframing software (there are a ton to choose from), collections of pre-made buttons and other GUI elements (especially common for smartphone apps where you can drag and drop stuff like on-screen keyboards into the mockup), and Adobe Creative Suite for pixel perfect mockups and assets (such as logos or new buttons).</p>

<p><strong>What does it take to be a UX designer?</strong> Yes, you need some artistic skills. Tsai was an art student. However, you need a lot of logic, not just artistry. Logic helps you solve the problem of meeting user needs through UI design, interaction design, IA, etc.</p>

<h2 id="users">Users</h2>
<p>UX design juggles a lot of objectives, but in the end, it’s all about merging the product’s objectives with the user’s needs. The example Tsai kept using was Amazon. Amazon’s objective is to sell stuff. The user wants to buy stuff. To do that, a user needs to be able to easily browse, search, etc.</p>

<p>So how do you know what users need? You interview them. Regarding user feedback, Tsai mentioned the following:</p>
<table>
	<colgroup>
		<col span="1" style="width: 50%;" />
		<col span="1" style="width: 50%;" />
	</colgroup>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td style="vertical-align: top; padding: 5px;">DO tap into your colleague&#8217;s friends and family. She emphasized the importance of that one degree of separation &#8211;it&#8217;s a bias killer, apparently.</td>
			<td style="vertical-align: top; padding: 5px;">DON&#8217;T interview friends and family who might be biased or afraid to hurt your precious feelings.</td>
		</tr><tr>
			<td style="vertical-align: top; padding: 5px;">DO ask users what apps they currently love. Try to find out what their general preferences/habits are. Find out how they interact with existing products (and how much they like it). Users are less likely to guess or unintentionally lie during an interview if you ask them about their current behavior rather than hypothetical behavior.</td>
			<td style="vertical-align: top; padding: 5px;">DON&#8217;T ask users what they think about a hypothetical work flow, interaction, process, product change, etc. Users don&#8217;t always understand the hypothetical impacts of hypothetical designs.</td>
		</tr><tr>
			<td style="vertical-align: top; padding: 5px;">DO find interviewees via Task Rabbit, Craigslist, or even Facebook.</td>
			<td style="vertical-align: top; padding: 5px;">DON&#8217;T be afraid to &#8220;cast a wide net&#8221; to get faster responses to your quest for feedback.</td>
	</tr></tbody></table>

<h1 id="what-i-thought">What I Thought</h1>
<p><strong>Tsai did a pretty great job. 9/10.</strong> Some of her presentation slides included small, hard-to-read text. It would’ve been fine for a smaller conference room, but I sat in the last row of chairs, and I couldn’t read a lot of the text. Other than that, she spoke well, the slides looked visually appealing, and she answered all questions easily.</p>

<p>I could do without the intro slide where she sighs over the fantastic view of the Bay Bridge she gets to enjoy on her daily walk to work. Then again, maybe I’m just cold-hearted; maybe other people loved that part of her talk.</p>

<p>I arrived 5 minutes late, but judging by the post-presentation Q&amp;A session, she neglected to describe her own career path at the beginning of her presentation. That’s a big oversight because this is an introductory talk! Of course audience members want to hear how you got your start! You can check out her LinkedIn by going to her website in case you’re wondering about her career history.</p>

<p>As for the content, after the one hour session, I definitely have a clearer picture of not just the roles of UX designers, but also the roles of those who interact with UX designers. <strong>The talk also gave noobs like me a better understanding of what it takes to make a web/mobile app.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The only real bummer was the acoustics.</strong> I’m going to whine a lot here, so skip to the <a href="#followup">followup</a> if you get bored. The General Assembly (GA) building is pretty nice. It has a few classrooms and conference rooms, but like all cool beans, GA uses a relatively open floor plan. Tsai’s presentation was held not in a classroom, but in an open area on the second floor. When I arrived, there were a handful of people working at nearby computers. They were chatting, as you’d expect, but that’s a distraction for audience members.</p>

<p>On top of that, the air conditioning system popped on during the last segment of the event, and it spooked Tsai. Everyone thought it was some annoying truck or something, but the sound didn’t go away. It really bothered Tsai. After she inquired, the GA staffer explained it was just the AC. Damn that was an annoying AC.</p>

<p>By the way, just like everyone else, I think exposed walls/ceilings, glass conference rooms, and open floor plans are slick as hell (especially compared to the drab corporate offices in DC). However, it’s <em>pretty obvious</em> that the recipe for office hawtness is also a recipe for poor acoustics. I’m surprised GA hosts presentations in the middle of an open floor of such a building. <strong>I give GA a score of 6/10.</strong> Yes, I’m sure my scores change the world.</p>

<p>Side note: When using folding chairs, is it possible to stagger the rows so then the columns don’t line up? This would help short folks like me see through the heads of taller people rather than staring at the back of the head of the tall guy sitting directly in front of me. I’m sure staggering rows would be less space-efficient, but if you’ve got a lot of rows, then the people in the back could sure use some help seeing the presenter and the projector screen.</p>

<h1 id="followup">Followup</h1>
<p>GA did a good job of following up with attendees. We were emailed a survey (in which I notified them of their crappy acoustics), a blurb about GA’s other UX classes, and two lists of resources, which you can see for yourself below.</p>

<p>Soon after I moved from the east coast, I set aside an afternoon to simply roam around downtown San Francisco. I was really excited to grab my crummy-yet-trusty, point-and-shoot Panasonic Lumix TS-1, and just be a tourist.</p>

<p>To my delight, I discovered that the hilly nature of the city lends itself to providing fantastic views. Also, being short helps me conquer hills.</p>

<p>I compiled some of those views into a brief clip because I think I can do a better job of sharing vistas through my camera’s video recording than through its photo capturing …and because I like adding music to visuals.</p>

<h1 id="here-we-go">Here We Go</h1>
<p>Dammit. I’ve made so many tweaks and adjustments, but I still haven’t gotten this blog looking quite right. I’m about to get nerdy, so <a href="#whats-next">jump down</a> if you have no sympathy for programmer growing pains.</p>

<p>FYI, I’m using <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> to create this blog, <a href="https://github.com/RebootJeff">github</a> to host, and I write posts/pages in a little language called <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/Markdown/">Markdown</a>. Maybe I should’ve just created a WordPress blog, but I admit I fell victim to Octopress’s tagline: “A blogging framework for hackers.”</p>

<p>Some of you non-tech geeks may raise an eyebrow at the term “hacker,” but it’s really <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/gba.html">not as evil as you think</a>. The word embodies a more jargon-y connotation as well as the archetype portrayed in the media. In this case, Octopress is appealing to the techy DIY folks who like to have a lot of control over their creations (even at the expense of convenience…as is definitely the case for me).</p>

<h2 id="the-tweaks-never-end">The Tweaks Never End</h2>
<p>I began customizing this blog by adding a lovely Octopress theme. I then tweaked the hell out of it. You can compare and contrast by checking out the theme’s <a href="http://www.adrianartiles.com/">original implementation</a>. My changes customized the color scheme, the background image, the size of the hero (i.e., cover photo area on the home page), the Twitter widget, the footer, navigation links, etc.</p>

<p>The customization process was tough because I had never seen a <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers">Liquid</a> setup before. Also, I’m fairly new to git, Ruby, and the other bits involved in an Octopress-powered blog. I had to delete, re-install, and re-clone more times than I care to disclose.</p>

<p><del>But I’m still not done. I still need to tweak the colors and the background image. I want a green theme because I think green is under-used. Unfortunately, it clashes with certain Markdown parts. I switched my blog’s Markdown engine to <a href="https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet">Redcarpet</a>, but I still get gross code blocks and lists. I tried using <a href="https://github.com/nono/Jekyll-plugins/blob/master/redcarpet2_markdown.rb">a Redcarpet plugin</a>, but that threw errors during the <code>rake generate</code> process. I tried <a href="http://blog.alestanis.com/2013/02/04/octopress-and-the-twilight-color-scheme/">kramdown</a> with a sweet <a href="https://github.com/danielpietzsch/CodeRay-GitHub-Theme">CodeRay theme</a>, but that setup completely ignored code blocks, block quotes, etc. I need help!</del></p>

<h3 id="update-aug-10-2013">Update! (Aug 10, 2013)</h3>
<p>I used <a href="http://html5devgal.com/blog/2013/06/08/octopress-toc-and-coderay-codeblocks/">HTML5 Dev Gal</a>’s helpful instructions and links to finally implement the alliterative combo of Kramdown and CodeRay. I also realized how to add custom CSS to specifically address lists created via the Markdown engine.</p>

<p>So hooray! Lists and Code blocks are no longer given a ridiculous dark blue background! And why were lists given a background anyway?</p>

<p>Sadly, <a href="http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/converter/html.html#toc">automatic TOCs</a> don’t seem to work. I also still need to figure out how to add autolinking, which works in stock Octopress, but once modified to use kramdown, shit’s broken?</p>

<h1 id="tldr">TL;DR</h1>
<p>I’m whining about how difficult it can be to use a DIY path, but it’s really helped me learn a lot. So it’s all good.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>
<p>So what can you expect on this blog other than sentences that probably shouldn’t start with the word “so”?</p>

<h3 id="past">Past</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Difficulties of my cross-country move</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="present">Present</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Chronicles of my career change</li>
  <li>Short reviews</li>
  <li>Compilations of cool links I’ve found</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="future">Future</h3>
<ul>
  <li>My goals, targets, milestones</li>
  <li>My thoughts on the future of tech, cars, gaming, music, tennis, and more</li>

# My Projects

## Co-Compare

Comparison-shopping tool? Survey polling tool? Forum flame war tool? Maybe it's all of the above.

I get pretty serious about comparing products/services, so I made a vote-gathering web app to facilitate the process of finding out what kind of general consensus exists.

# Team Projects

## Phone Tag

Smartphone game played outdoors. Game mechanics resemble laser tag, but with a geolocation twist: players are equipped with a radar shown on their phones. Certain game mechanices require players to run to certain locations.

What I love about this product is its ability to merge technology with good, old-fashioned outdoor exercise.

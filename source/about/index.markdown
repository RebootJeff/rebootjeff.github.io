My name is Jeff, and I am rebooting my life. I switched coasts, and I am switching careers. I will be a web developer by the end of 2013.

# I am rebooting
In the summer of 2012, self-doubt and hope clashed in a slow, drawn-out war in my mind. By autumn of 2012, the winner was clear. I decided that I would try to reboot my life. There were some delays, but in the spring of 2013, I quit my job as a consultant/data analyst. It was the first full-time employment I had ever experienced.

In the summer of 2013, I swapped coasts in search of a techier life (so to speak). Moving across the states was quite a difficult process, and when I arrived in [California](http://vimeo.com/71790058), self-doubt reminded me that it was never completely vanquished.

I didn't know what to expect, and I didn't even know what to look for. All I knew was that my life had been fortunate enough to afford me the opportunity to do some exploring. If you're single and have a white collar career, it doesn't make sense to stop yourself from exploring.

During the initial stages of post-move unemployment, I started to consider a career in software development. After a month or so, I started looking at the web development branch of software development. Eventually, I found out about [coding bootcamps](http://bootcamper.io/). I spent a lot of August 2013 applying to five different web development bootcamps, and I ended up [choosing Hack Reactor](/blog/2013/08/25/hack-reactor-is-my-future/) as the catalyst of my personal reboot.

# I am documenting
I've been fond of typing tons of text since the good ol' days of Xanga. There is generally too much on my mind at any given time, but blogging helps ease the overflow.

RebootJeff.com will cover my thoughts, discoveries, and adventures involved in revamping my life. Considering that a career change is a major aspect of this life of mine, this blog will mostly focus on subjects related to web development. For the near-term (i.e., the last one-third of 2013), coding bootcamps will be the primary focus of this website.

If you're wondering how I put together this blog, check out [my first post](/blog/2013/08/02/ready-set-octopress/) and any posts tagged with the "[blog customization](/blog/categories/blog-customization/)" category.

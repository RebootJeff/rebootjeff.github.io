A little over six months have passed since I graduated from Hack Reactor. What's the situation like now? How's life after Hack Reactor? What's it like to transition out of 70-hour work weeks at Hack Reactor? How was the post-graduation job search? How have my views on Hack Reactor changed when given the clarity of hindsight? I'm glad you asked because I find typing to be quite satisfying.

By early August of 2013, I finally had a concrete plan of what to do in order to re-route my life. Not only did I want to work with code, but I wanted to learn how to be a good programmer by [enrolling in a coding bootcamp](/blog/2013/08/25/hack-reactor-is-my-future/). I dedicated my time to researching and applying to various coding bootcamps in the Bay Area.

Although this post focuses on one geographical location, I hope it helps others as they apply to immersive programs based in various cities across the globe.

# Applications

I filled out applications for RocketU and Coding Dojo first. Then I submitted applications for Hack Reactor, General Assembly, and App Academy. All applications consisted of web forms that were fairly straightforward, but some included interesting mini-essays. You can visit their respective websites and find the forms yourself, but I just want to mention that they aren't too time-consuming.

Also, you should relax after submitting an application because **it took 2-7 days for the bootcamps to respond to my applications.** I think some bootcamps provided automatic confirmation emails to let me know they got my application, but if I recall correctly, at least one bootcamp didn't give me any sanity-fostering confirmation email.

## App Academy wants to weed out applicants ASAP
I don't remember if the response was immediate or took a few days to come my way, but soon after I submitted my App Academy application, I got an email telling me that I had to complete a 45-minute Ruby quiz before my admissions process could continue.

The quiz came with instructions to help me study/prepare. It did not come with a deadline, and there was no countdown timer even though I was told I only had 45 minutes to finish. The quiz just involved implementing some functions. I completed the challenges in about 20-30 minutes. I then spend another 15 minutes refactoring the code. I'm not too familiar with Ruby, but I did learn a lot of fun things about the language that makes it possible to write incredibly concise code.

A day after I submitted my quiz, I got an email telling me to do yet another quiz. At this point, I was not happy. Clearly, App Academy wants to really weed people out of their admissions. I understand that, but I very badly wanted to start the interview process sooner than later. A second quiz meant I'd have to spend more time studying Ruby when I was already busy with applying to other bootcamps and preparing for their interviews.

Maybe I should've given them a chance, but I was already less interested in App Academy because they didn't seem to stand out in any way other than their deferred payment plan. So I ended up abandoning my App Academy application, and I never got an interview with them.

# Interviews

It's important to consider that **the interview process is as much an opportunity for them to wow you as it is a time for you to impress them.** This is why I looked forward to each interview. I couldn't wait to be wowed. This is also why I was disappointed when App Academy put another challenge in my path towards an interview.

Before each interview, I reviewed my research on the particular bootcamp. I re-visited the bootcamp's website and their blog to find nuggets of info worth asking them about. A lot of my questions probed for elaboration on something very specific to the bootcamp in question.

I had handful of standard questions about logistics, a few questions comparing them against their competitors, questions about curriculae, etc. You can find a list of questions at the end of this blog post.

I'm not going to write an in-depth review of all the answers I got to all my questions ...yet. I plan to do that in future blog posts where I just dump all the info I've gathered about one bootcamp at a time. For this blog post, I'm just going to talk about the interview processes and the general vibes I noticed. I will also include suggestions based on my experiences with bootcamp admissions.

## My interviewing advice

- Write down a ton of questions to ask for the final half/third of your interview. Asking a lot of questions makes you look AWESOME.
	- Ask questions that show you're planning ahead (i.e., questions about logistics).
	- Ask questions that show you're serious (i.e., thoughtful questions and very specific questions).
- Be prepared to answer basic questions that you already answered in your applications forms. Examples:
	- Why do you want to do a bootcamp?
	- How did you hear about us?
	- Why do you want to learn to code?
	- Can you handle the intensity of our program? Are you sure? Are you sure you're sure?
	- What prior programming experience do you have?
- Do NOT panic during the technical portion of the interviews. If you don't know something, just admit it. They don't expect you to be an expert; they just want to see how much you know so far by asking progressively harder questions until they get to topics beyond your current experience.

## Coding Dojo
Before my interview with Coding Dojo, **I was emailed a link to a private pre-interview video.** I was excited about what it could possibly cover. I was disappointed to learn it was an FAQs video. I won't reveal the link or password, but I will give a quick overview of the contents.

The video was a mediocre-quality recording of Coding Dojo's founder, Michael Choi, talking to the camera. It was unedited, and just didn't feel very professional. The whole time I watched him answer some FAQs, I kept wondering why the answers weren't on the FAQ page of the Coding Dojo website. Why were these questions and answers password-protected?

Maybe it's because Michael answered questions comparing Coding Dojo to its competitors by admitting that their hiring network was smaller than most. The only reassurance provided was along the lines of "don't worry, we're working on it."

My first bootcamp interview was a phone call with a [Dexter Clark](http://www.linkedin.com/in/dexterclark), a Coding Dojo graduate-turned-teacher. He was incredibly nice, and I dug his personality. He didn't ask me any technical questions. He only asked me questions to help set my expectations and gauge my motivation.

He made me feel better about Coding Dojo, but I still figured the other bootcamps would probably do a better job of impressing me.

About 6 days after the interview, I was emailed an offer to enroll in Coding Dojo's September cohort.

Side note: I searched for more Coding Dojo videos on YouTube and Vimeo. I found some unedited videos profiling one student at a time. I'm a wannabe videographer, so feel free to acuse me of being a snob, but these videos really weren't ready for public consumption. It seems like a high quality camera is being used, but the subjects are not in focus, there are a lot of filler words ("uh" and "um"), and the audio levels aren't right.

For example, one video involves Choi asking a student some questions. In the middle of the recording, the student starts getting up from his chair so Choi has to inform him that the interview isn't over yet.

The videos need to be edited, and the students need to be prepped so they look more comfortable rather than looking like they're being put on the spot. For the students' sake, I won't link to the videos I found. Hopefully, Coding Dojo will take them down sooner than later.

## Hack Reactor
My interviews with HackR were in person. By visiting their facility, I got to soak in a great vibe. It was like the main room was buzzing with a consistent, high level of focus. Their office space consists of one big main room that has an open kitchen area and an open lecture area.

Call me shy, but I was disappointed that there was no receptionist to greet me. I walked into the main room and I had no idea who to talk to for my first interview. Eventually, I knocked on a door, and it happened to be the right one.

I was interviewed by HackR's CEO, [Anthony (Tony) Phillips](http://www.quora.com/Anthony-Phillips-1) and [Eric Levine](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/eric-levin/28/b05/682), a HackR grad-turned-teaching-assistant (aka Hacker-in-Residence). Their pre-interview email told me what to study for their technical questions.

The technical questions were so easy (basic JavaScript) that I made some careless mistakes during the live coding. Woops. Actually, there was one question where I did a bit too much thinking so my code was more complicated than necessary. Tony and Eric helped me edit my code.

Then, they asked me some questions to set my expectations (i.e., they wanted to make sure I knew that their program is no joke; it's seriously intense) and guage my motivation. They also wanted to make sure I had the financial ability to pay the high tuition.

My first HackR interview was scheduled for 1 hour, but it lasted for at least 1.5 hours because I asked a crapload of questions. By the time I interviewed with them, I was already extra excited about them because of [their thoughtful responses to Quora questions](http://www.quora.com/Hack-Reactor) and past and present [student blogs](http://kevinhamiltonsmith.com/hack-reactor-student-blogs/).

Side note: Phillips seemed a bit surprised when I asked him about their refund policy. That's ironic when you consider that [their own blog suggests you ask all bootcamps about refunds](http://hackreactor.com/developer-bootcamp-contracts).

After the first interview, I soon signed up for the second

## RocketU

## General Assembly

# Interview questions for YOU to ask

You might think it's hard to come up with interesting questions. I used to think that way, but then I stopped being cynical for 2 seconds so then my mind could do some brainstorming. Here are a few ideas for finding inspiration:

## Question Topics

- Ask questions about something interesting mentioned on the bootcamp's blog.
- Ask questions about specific topics covered by their curriculum.
- Find the interviewer's LinkedIn profile or Twitter feed. You might find something cool to ask about.
- Ask for examples of something they brag about (e.g., if they brag about guest speakers or networking events ask more about those).
- Check out [my list of factors](/blog/2013/09/04/coding-bootcamp-research-how-to-compare-bootcamps/). Formulate questions about them.

## Examples

### Logistics

- What are the exact start and end dates for the cohort that starts in (INSERT MONTH HERE)?
- How many students and teachers are there?
- Does the bootcamp use a rolling cohort system?
- Holidays?
- Typical day's hours?
- What are your payment plans/options?
	- Do you have a refund policy?
- Are there any special requirements?
	- Do I need a Mac/Linux?

### Qualifications
- What kind of experience do the faculty have?
- How do you help students find jobs?
- How often do students find jobs after graduation?
- Do you have any hiring/company partners?
- Do you conduct any alumni outreach?
	- What kind of support do you provide to alumni?
- What are the roles of the various faculty/staff members?
	- How much attention will I get from lead instructors versus part-time instructors versus junior assistants?

### Technical
- Why did you choose to cover language X instead of language Y?
- How much of the curriculum features group projects versus individual projects versus quick assignments?

### Personality/Culture/Vision
- What's your favorite bootcamp-hosted event?
	- E.g., fire-side chat, guest speaker, social event, networking event, etc.
- Why did you decide to work for the bootcamp?
- What is your favorite part (aka sprint) of the curriculum?
- What personality traits do your students have in common?
	- How much experience do your students have before starting the course?
- Do you ever kick out students? (You may want to re-phrase this question to be less blunt)
	- How do you help struggling students?
	- How do you ensure no students fall behind?

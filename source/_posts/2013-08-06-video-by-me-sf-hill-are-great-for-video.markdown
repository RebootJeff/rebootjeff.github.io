###<a href="http://vimeo.com/71790058">Wandering Around: Bits of SF</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user19992362">Jeff Lee</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>

Soon after I moved from the east coast, I set aside an afternoon to simply roam around downtown San Francisco. I was really excited to grab my crummy-yet-trusty, point-and-shoot Panasonic Lumix TS-1, and just be a tourist.

To my delight, I discovered that the hilly nature of the city lends itself to providing fantastic views. Also, being short helps me conquer hills.

I compiled some of those views into a brief clip because I think I can do a better job of sharing vistas through my camera's video recording than through its photo capturing ...and because I like adding music to visuals.

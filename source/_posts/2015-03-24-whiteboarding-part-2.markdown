### Use Collaborative Language
Say "we" instead of "I" as much as possible to cultivate a sense of collaboration and teamwork. You probably noticed that teachers tend to use inclusive words like "we". It just feels better. If you do pair programming, it becomes more natural. E.g., "First **we** will iterate over the array and process the elements to make a new array. **Let's** do this with the `map` method."

### Handwriting Matters
If your handwriting sucks, slow down and put some effort into writing neatly. It's really annoying to have to decipher ugly handwriting. It's much worse when it's ugly, handwritten *code*. It might not be a deal-breaker, but it can make a smooth road into a bumpy one.

### What Do YOU Care About?
Ask yourself, "If I were hiring engineers right now. What would I care about when interviewing them?" You probably use some intuition and real-world concerns to answer that question. Your answers can help you perform better during an interview. Some examples:

- You probably care that a candidate can identify potential issues. Can they come up with example edge cases?.
- You probaby want to see if a candidate knows best practices. Is their code clean, testable, modular, performant?
- You might want to see if a candidate is familiar with particular tech. Do they know common tactics for a particular framework? Do they know how to write optimized queries for a particular 3rd party REST API?
- You likely care about collaboration. Can this candidate communicate well? Do they write code that's easy for others to read?

Take these questions and make sure you "answer" when you are interviewed. As you write code during an interview, mention that you are doing XYZ to improve readability, mention that line 4 is a best practice, mention that you set up the function to be more testable by doing ABC. And so on.

### Discover A New Perspective
To dive deeper into the previous tip, try conducting a mock interview of a friend. Imagine what it's like to be the interviewer rather than the interviewee. Now imagine that you're a busy engineer who has to use valuable time to interview someone. Use that perspective to identify ways to make life easier for the interviewer. Some of my advice might sound stupid until you think of interviews from the interviewer's perspective (e.g., ugly handwriting).

### Skip around
When solving a problem, you usually want to break it down into smaller sub-problems. After you do that, you might find that some sub-problems are harder to conquer than others. That's fine. Via breadth-first coding, it should be easy to skip a sub-problem and come back to it later. This way, you maximize the amount of time in which you can demonstrate confident coding.

For example, let's say you have 15 minutes to complete a challenge. You've divided the problem into 3 parts. The 2nd part is really tough. The 1st and 3rd parts are easy to conquer in 5 minutes each. Well go ahead and solve the easy parts in the first 10 minutes and leave the rest for the 2nd part. That would be better than finishing the 1st part, getting stuck on the 2nd part, and not even starting the 3rd part. This advice is pretty much the classic "skip and come back" advice pertaining to quizzes, exams, tests, etc.

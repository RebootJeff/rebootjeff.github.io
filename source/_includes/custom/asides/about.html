<h2>My name is Jeff</h2>
<p class="about_blurb">I'm writing about my dive into web development, but I'll probably write about other interests too.</p>
<p class="about_blurb">Tennis, cars, videography, photography, music, movies, exploring the west coast, composition of the universe, aesthetics of everything, meditation, and general geekery tend to be on my mind as well.</p>

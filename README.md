# RebootJeff's Octopress Blog

This is the repo for my blog, which is created by using the [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) blogging platform. In other words, I did not write the Ruby that generates the static files used for my blog.

If you are an employer checking out my GitHub, please **DO NOT** judge my abilities based on the code/architecture of this blog. If you're confused, please read about how Octopress works.
